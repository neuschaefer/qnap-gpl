.SH DESCRIPTION
lvmetad is a metadata caching daemon for LVM. The daemon receives notifications
from udev rules (which must be installed for LVM to work correctly when lvmetad
is in use). Through these notifications, lvmetad has an up-to-date and
consistent image of the volume groups available in the system.

By default, lvmetad, even if running, is not used by LVM. See \fBlvm.conf\fP(5).
