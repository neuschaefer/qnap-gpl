Overview
--------

  ACPID used to try to handle events internally.  Rather than try to climb
  an ever-growing mountain, ACPID now lets YOU define what events to handle.
  Any event that publishes itself to /proc/acpi/event can be handled.

  ACPID reads a set of configuration files which define event->action pairs.
  This is how you make it do stuff. See the man page for details.

Implementation status
---------------------

  This version should have complete support for generic handling of events.

Requirements
------------

  For 2.6 and newer 2.4 kernels, ACPI seems to be fully integrated.  That
  should be all you need.

  The ACPI kernel driver should be working on your system before trying
  ACPID.  Verify ACPI is loaded by verifying the existence of
  /proc/acpi/event.

Compiling ACPID
---------------

  type "make"
