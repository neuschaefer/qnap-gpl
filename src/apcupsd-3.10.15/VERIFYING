All apcupsd packages released on Source Forge after 24 July 2003
will be signed with the apcupsd Distribution Verification Key.  By
obtaining a copy of the apcupsd Distribution Verification Public
key from either the home site (www.apcupsd.com) or from the Source
Forge project page, (www.sourceforge.net/projects/apcupsd).  you
can verify that the code you have is complete, unaltered, and
packaged by myself (Kern Sibbald) or D. Scott Barninger.

Putting the apcupsd Key in your Keyring:

Once you download the apcupsd public key, you must insert it in
your keyring.  The procedure will differ depending on whether you
are using PGP or GPG.  For GPG, assuming you have put the key
in apcupsd.k, the procedure is:

  gpg --import apcupsd.key

Verifying an RPM:

The procedure for verification differs slightly if you are using
rpms or tar.gz files. For rpms, the signature becomes part of the
rpm package, and once the apcupsd public key is in your keyring
you check the package with:

  rpm --checksig apcupsd-3.10.xx.rpm

Verifying tar files:

Tar files are distributed as they always have been in the past,
unchanged. However, for each xxxx.tar.gz file that is released there
will be a second file released with the same name but with .sig
appended, for example xxxx.tar.gz.sig.  To verify the apcupsd distribution,
you download both the files and put them in the same directory, then
for GPG, you use the following command to do the verification:

  gpg --verify xxxx.tar.gz.sig
