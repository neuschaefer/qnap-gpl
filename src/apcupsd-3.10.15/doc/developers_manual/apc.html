<a NAME="Meanings of G command"></a>Meanings of G command</h3>

<p><br>I received the inquiry below, which warrants a response to the whole
list:
<p>"Once every 14 days the UPS does an automatic self test. apcupsd thinks
there has been a power failure because it detects a switch to batteries.
PowerChute seems to know that a power test is underway. Question: how can
I tell when the UPS is doing an automatic power test rather than in a power
fail condition ?"
<p>The G command gives the cause of the most recent transfer to battery.
Responses to this command are:
<p>R - Transfer to battery due to rate of line voltage change
<br>H - Transfer to battery due to high line voltage
<br>L - Transfer to battery due to low line voltage
<br>T - Transfer to battery due to detection of line notch or spike
<br>O - No transfers have occurred yet
<br>S - The UPS was commanded to do a self-test by the front panel or serial
port
<p>After detecting that the UPS has transferred to battery, send the G,
then interpret the response. If the response is S, then the transfer was
due to a self test.

<p>Intellectual Property
<p>Although the Company believes that its processes and equipment are proprietary,
the Company has not sought patent protection for its technology. There
can be no assurance that the Company's processes and equipment provide
it with a competitive advantage or that others will not independently develop
equivalent or superior products or technology. In not seeking patent protection,
the Company has instead relied on the complexity of its technology, trade
secrecy laws and employee confidentiality agreements. One reason for not
seeking patent protection is to avoid the public disclosure of information
required for patent protection. The risk of not seeking patent protection
is that other companies may acquire information or technology which the
Company considers to be proprietary in design and manufacturing. The Company
believes that companies in its industry do not primarily rely on patents
to protect their proprietary rights. This belief is based upon certain
advertising and product literature that has come to the Company's attention.
This does not imply that the Company or any of its competitors will not
seek patent protection as future technology evolves.
