<a NAME="APC Interface Expander"></a>APC Interface Expander</h3>

<p><br>I tried out some things with the multimeter:
<p>Pin2 on the ups has -11V and changes to +11V on Linefail. Couldnt test
the Pin3, 5 &amp; 1 actions. But i think it should work. Any suggestions?
<br>I tried two different machines, different serial cards. Btw. with the
smart cable on the advanced port, everything is fine.
<br>Im getting alwais the error message: Serial communication with UPS
lost (but how can the software determinate if there is a connection, on
a simple cable???).
<br>So the last question remains. How does the software communicate via
the dumb cable with the ups? Imho there is no "serial communication", so
how can the software determinate if there is a communication with the ups?
<br>The following port description is from the apc interface expander manual:
<p>------------------------> 3 Normal Open, Line Fail Signal
<p>|
<p>| ----------------->5 Normal Open, Low Bat Signal
<p>| |
<p>| | ---------->6 Normal Closed, Line Fail Signal
<p>| | |
<p>\ \ \
<p>\ &lt; \&lt; |>

<p>| | |
<p>+-- --+------+---+------>4 Common
<p>|
<p>-----------&lt;1 UPS Shut Down RS232 Input (Hi-4.5 sec)
<p>|
<p>----------->2 Line Fail RS232 Output
<p>|
<p>+----> 9 Chassis
<p>|
<p>---
<p>So on pin 3,5,6 and 2 the ups status is only signaled via hi or low
signals, but there is no communication at all. And pin 1 is only used to
shut down the ups (if there is a hi signal for 4.5 seconds).
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="APC Powercell Network"></a>APC Powercell Network</h3>

<p><br>After reading your thoughts, here's a couple followup details to
clarify things: my APC Powercell Network (circa 1995) UPS does *not* appear
to be a "smart" UPS. The DB9 port wiring diagram, as described in the user
guide, indicates simple voltage levels as such:
<p>UPS Pin Direction Purpose
<p>1 &lt;--- Accepts pulse input to shutdown UPS
<br>2 ---> Line fail output (+5 when true, +0 when false)
<br>3 ---> Line fail output (ground when true, open when false)
<br>4 ---> Chassis Ground
<br>5 ---> Low Batt output (ground when true, open when false)
<br>6 ---> Line fail output (open when true, ground when false)
<br>7 ---> n/c
<br>8 ---> n/c
<br>9 ---> Chassis Ground
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I am focusing on pin 5, "Low Batt output" which goes to ground when
true. The (skimpy) APC User's Manual doesn't describe this in detail, but
says, "...if the utility power is not restored to normal, the PowerCell
will eventually sound a loud tone to alert you that less than two minutes
remain before the UPS shuts down and ceases to power your equipment. This
is called a LOW BATTERY CONDITION which means that the PowerCell's usable
battery capacity is nearly spent." I suspect, but have not (yet) tested,
that the "Low Batt output" goes TRUE at this two-minute mark. I also suspect
that the "two minute" measurement is based upon full [400W] load, and would
be MUCH longer on a very light load [25W] like mine.

<p>Basic ports
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The funtionality of a Share-UPS Basic port is shown below. The following
limitations and capabilities apply the the basic port interface:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
pins 3, 5 and 6 are open collector outputs which must be pulled up to a
common referenced supply no greater than +40Vdc. The transistors are capable
of a maximun non-inductive oad of 25mAdc. Use only Pin 4 as the common.</li>

<li>
The output at Pin 2 generate a Lo-to-HI RS232 level what the device is
signaling On-Battery. The pin is normally at a LO RS-232 level.</li>

<li>
The Share-Ups may be signaled to shutdown the UPS by applying a HI RS-232
level to Pin 1 for 4.5 seconds. Shutdown is also dependent on the UPS~s
state and the Share-UPS~s shutdown mode.</li>

<h3>
<a NAME="BackUPS"></a>BackUPS</h3>

<p><br>The RTS serial port signal is used to shut down the UPS. The UPS
will shut down only if it operates from its battery. The manual says that
the shutdown signal must be high for at least 0.5s. But few milliseconds
is enough, at least for my APC Back-UPS 600.
<p>Using RTS to shut down the UPS can be dangerous, because the RTS goes
high when the serial device is opened. The backupsd program then turns
RTS off, but it is on (high) for a moment. This kills the power when backupsd
is first started and there is a power failure at this time. This can happen
for example when the UPS is shut down, unattended, and the power comes
back for a while.
<p>Either start backupsd before mounting any filesystems for read-write,
or (better) use TX (pin 3) instead of RTS (pin 7) to shut down the UPS
(pin numbers are for 9-pin plug). Use ioctl(fd, TCSBRKP, 10); to make TX
high for one second, for example. Using TX should be safe. Maybe I will
post the diffs if time permits...

<br>Subject: APC cable question..
<p>I admit that after reading your README's and the stuff at APC I am thoroughly
confused about which cable to buy/make -- I have an APC Smart-UPS 600 running
a 586 RH 4.1 Linux box. I don't see a listing for #940-024(B/C) at the
APC site -- just 940-020, with no character designators (B/C/anythingElse...)
<p>I guess my question is: To incorporate SmartUPS "Smart Mode" support
do I buy a #940-020B, -024(B/C) or make the cable illustrated in your Sept
<p>20, 1996 comment?

<br>Subject: APC #940-0095A cable
<p>Hi,
<p>I have been messing around trying to get my APC Back-UPS Pro PNP to
work under Linux. In the process of trying to figure out how the included
cable is built (#940-0095A), I fried the cable. I took this as an opportunity
to dissect the cable and find out what is really inside. After a lot of
work with an X-acto knife, I figured it out.
<p>Since you're maintaining apcupsd, and you state that this cable is "insupportable",
I thought you might be interested in this information. Perhaps it will
help you to support the cable, and thus help other people with this UPS.
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Construction and operation of the APC #940-0095A cable. This cable is
included with the APC Back-UPS Pro PNP series.

<p>Operation:
<p>* DTR is "cable power" and must be held at SPACE. DSR or CTS may be
used as a loopback input to determine if the cable is plugged in.
<p>* DCD is the "battery low" signal to the computer. A SPACE on this line
means the battery is low. This is signalled by BATTERY-LOW being pulled
down (it is probably open circuit normally).
<p>Normally, the transistor is turned off, and DCD is held at the MARK
voltage by TxD. When BATTERY-LOW is pulled down, the voltage divider R2/R1
biases the transistor so that it is turned on, causing DCD to be pulled
up to the SPACE voltage.
<p>* TxD must be held at MARK; this is the default state when no data is
being transmitted. This sets the default bias for both DCD and SHUTDOWN.
If this line is an open circuit, then when BATTERY-LOW is signalled, SHUTDOWN
will be automatically signalled; this would be true if the cable were plugged
in to the UPS and not the computer, or if the computer were turned off.
<p>* RTS is the "shutdown" signal from the computer. A SPACE on this line
tells the UPS to shut down.
<p>* RxD and RI are both the "power-fail" signals to the computer. A MARK
on this line means the power has failed.
<p>* SPACE is a positive voltage, typically +12V. MARK is a negative voltage,
typically -12V. The RS-232 hardware translates SPACE to a 0 and MARK to
a 1.

<br>#940-0024C Now Supported
<p>There is NOW SmartUPS "Smart Mode" support!!!!!!!!!
<p>BackUPS Pro "Smart Mode" support unknown???????????
<p>USE_SMART=(yes/no) depending on UPS type.
<p>BackUPS Pro "Smart Mode" may be able to use USE_SMART=yes
<p>----> Enhanced_APC_UPS v1.9 Apr 14 1997
<p>----> Enhanced_APC_UPS v1.8 Apr 7 1997
<p>-D_SMARTUPS can no longer be define if you select USE_APC=yes There
is no SmartUPS "Smart Mode" support, it has never been available. I am
waiting to hear from APC about pinouts for the following cables #940-0023A
their Unix OS cable and #940-0095A their Win95OS cable. If you want to
use and APC cable, you must have cable #940-0020B ONLY....
<p>----> Sept 20 1996:
<p>One may choose to use the include files ( inittab, rc.6, and rc.inet2
)
<p>You may use this cable with both the Back-UPS and Smart-UPS from APC.
<br>YES, I did state the above line, but you must set in the CONFIG file
<br>Both cables for the Back-UPS from APC only have been tested and are
in use on three different Linux-Boxes.
<p>Cable for a smarter Back-UPS from APC only.

<br>&nbsp;
<p>*BELOW*
<p>List if componets one needs to make this CABLE:
<p>1) One (1) male DB9 connector.
<br>2) One (1) female DB25 or DB9 connector. solder type not crimp DB connectors
with standard hoods.
<br>3) two (2) 4.7K ohm 1/4 watt %5 resistors.
<br>4) one (1) foot of 3/32" (inch).
<br>5) shrink wrap/boot.
<br>6) rosin core solder.
<br>7) three (3) to five (5) feet of 22AWG multi-stranded five (5) conductor
cable.
<p>First solder both of the resistors into pin# (4) DB9 or (20) DB25 the
DTR. This will be used as the Vcc pull-up voltage for testing the outputs
on you "BackUPS by APC" !!!! ONLY !!!!, all others at your own RISK!!!!!!
<p>Next bend each of the resistors so that one connects to (8) DB9 or (5)
DB25 the CTS (aka battery low signal) and the other to (2) DB9 or (3) DB25
the RxD (aka another line fail signal). This line is not currently used,
but it will be in the near future.
<p>Note: 8/5 is also wire to pin# 5 on the UPS side of the cable.
<br>Note: 2/3 is also wire to pin# 3 on the UPS side of the cable.
<br>Note: we use the DTR as our +5 volts power for the circuit.
<p>The rest of the wire connections are listed above.
<p>I use this cable and daemon on my server that controls an APC BackUPS-600VA
that has one Cisco 1005 ISDN/Enet router, one 24-port HP-Enet Hub, and
one server (AMD-5x86-P75) w/o monitor. Enjoy the power security of UPS
control.
