Porting APCUPSD to other architectures</h2>

<p><br>Porting apcupsd seem to be quite easy at least at first glance.
The most important thing for porting APCUPSD is OS detection. It is done
in configure.in with the macro AM_CONDITIONAL and AC_DEFINE.
<p>The AM_CONDITIONAL is for Makefile generating HAVE_SUN_OS_TRUE=' ' or
HAVE_SUN_OS_TRUE='#' for example if you have or not SUNOS. It expand these
variables and they become comments or spaces. It is used for selecting
the compiler switches but even for selecting parts of code based on which
is the local architecture. The AC_DEFINE define HAVE_SUN_OS in the config.h
file so that the C preprocessor can know which OS we are compiling for.
<p>For adding a new OS in configure.in add these lines:
<p>if test $HAVE_UNAME=yes -a x`uname -s` = xSunOS
<br>then
<br>&nbsp; AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_NEW_OS, /bin/true)
<br>&nbsp; AC_DEFINE(HAVE_NEW_OS)
<br>else
<br>&nbsp; AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_NEW_OS, /bin/false)
<br>fi
<p>In acconfig.h add:
<p>#undef HAVE_NEW_OS
<p>then regenerate the configure script and config.h.in files with autoregen.sh.
This design is useful for compilers too. I have added checks for GCC so
that the Makefile know if we are using GCC or not.
