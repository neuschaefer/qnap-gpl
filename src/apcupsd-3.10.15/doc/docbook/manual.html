--- Release apcupsd-3.10.12 (xx February 2004)
- Minor updates to the documentation from user input.
- Fix a Makefile find that removes zero length files, which fails                 
  on some systems.
- Web site update.
- Apply patch from Adam that fixes OpenBSD and FreeBSD pthreads 
  library bugs.
- Add poll time to SNMP driver, and correct header file prototyping.
- Make usb driver sleep for 1 second then retry up to 10 times
  if the device cannot be opened. There are two such loops so in
  the event of failure, it will occur 20 seconds later. This
  allows time for the hotplug program to initialize the USB devices
  after a boot.
</pre><p>Change Log for versions 3.10.7-3.10.11</p><pre class="programlisting">
--- Release apcupsd-3.10.11 (26 January 2004)
- Correct apccontrol script to remove extra ;; that I inadvertantly
  left the last release -- apparently that prevented proper shutdown.
- Updates to manual as requested by Adam and other users.
- Fix localtime_r in configure.in as reported with patch by Adam.
- Fixed bad html in multimoncss.c reported by an anonymous user.
- Added new Mandrake apcupsd.spec.in submitted by David Walser.
- Revert to using the old master/slave networking code bu default.

--- Release apcupsd-3.10.10 (16 January 2004)
- This version has an additional fix to the USB driver based on
  work by Adam Kropelin -- it limits the rate at which apcupsd will
  poll the UPS for the volatile data, which in turn reduces the possiblity
  of flooding the kernel with control messages (hide-core.c: control
  queue full ...&quot;.
15Jan04
- I added a new &quot;offbattery&quot; event that is only executed if the 
  &quot;onbattery&quot; event was executed. This should allow users to easily
  control what messages they get and by using the ONBATTERYDELAY the
  time on batteries before the onbattery event is notified.

--- Release apcupsd-3.10.9 (31 December 2003)
31Dec03
- Bartlomiej Krol found an unexpected interaction between the 6 second
  &quot;debounce&quot; code and the new ONBATTERY delay time that caused the
  USB and apcsmart drivers to sleep for a long time.

--- Release apcupsd-3.10.8 (28 December 2003)
28Dec03
- Added upsBaiscOntrolConverveBattery change to smtp requested by
  Kastus Shchuka (kastus@list.sourceforge.net) 
- Move wall in killpower of apccontrol to after killpower to avoid 
  errors stopping script.
- Install apctest along with apcupsd.
- Fix DISTVER for RH Enterprise
19Dec03
- Added patch by Adam Kropelin that ignores invalid samples. This 
  eliminates the need for the wait, and seems to calm the system. Apparently, 
  even though apcupsd did not use the bad samples, it would break from the
  wait loop, and request an update, which gave even more bad samples. With
  Adam's patch the samples are simply dropped and we continue waiting (if 
  appropriate).  Thanks Adam.
18Dec03
- Add Slackware updated patch submitted by Andrei Mamontov
- Corrected the missing library dependencies in src/Makefile.in
  Thanks to Reg. Clemens for pushing me a bit on this.
06Dec03
- Added usleep(10000) provided by Reg. Clemens, which resolves the
  apcuspd USB problems on 2.6 kernels. Now removed by 19Dec03 patch.
24Nov03
- Added a ONBATTERYDELAY to the conf file. This is the time in
  seconds that apcupsd will wait after detecting a power failure
  until it sets the onbattery state.  If you do not want to be
  annoyed by short power outages (usually less than 10 seconds),
  set the ONBATTERYDELAY appropriately and comment out the
  powerout) &quot;echo ...|wall&quot; statement.
- I finally got the no driver configured error. It turns out that the
  Makefile detection of changes is all botched up. Since I don't understand
  how the author expected it to work, I used the sledgehammer approach and
  do a &quot;make clean&quot; on every ./configure.
- Replaced apcnet.c with Howard Wilkinson's new master/slave code. If
  anyone *really* needs the old driver, it is in src/apcnet.c.old
- Upgraded to Cygwin 1.5.5

--- Release apcupsd-3.10.7 (xx November 2003)
08Nov03
- Do automatic UPS detection in the USB code if no device is specified
  or if the specified device cannot be opened.
- Include patch provided by Howard Wilkinson, but put the new apcnet.c
  in apcnet.c.new until I have a chance to examine it in detail.

  His notes:
  I attach a complete rewrite of the Master side of the mast/slave code
  to support asynchronous connections to slaves.  I needed to do this as
  our network has a number of machines that tend to be powered off for
  long periods and the connect() calls were hanging around for more than
  nettime.
  I also, added a small patch for a new command line flag
  '-P|--pid-file' so that I can easily run multiple daemons on one
   machine.  I needed this as I have a machine that acts as a multiple
   master while getting its power from another UPS managed by another
   machine.

- Lib wrappers was not building correctly on FreeBSD due to the 
  library -lnls, so I copied over the Bacula code for configure.
  Thanks to Lars Koeller for reporting this and for his patches.
- Attempt to get mkinstalldirs called by an absolute path rather
  than relative.
- Apply Lars' fixes to platforms/Makefile.in and platforms/etc/Makefile.in
  Install scripts with $(INSTALL_SCRIPT) instead of $(INSTALL_PROGRAM)
- Close all file descriptors except stdin/out/err.
- If there are no stdin/out/err (Windows), then create them and point them
  to /dev/null.  This prevents the serial port from suddenly getting
  debug output sent to it -- chaos.
- It seems that since the beginning of 3.10.x, the APCSMART_UPS never
  reported the proper status. This is because it was not in the case
  statement. Incredible since it is now the &quot;standard&quot; driver! Thanks
  to the user that brought this to my attention.
- Fix a segfault in linux-usb.c due to reference one beyond the command
  table. This happens only on newer USB UPSes. Thanks to the user who
  pointed this out.

--- Release apcupsd-3.10.6a (30 October 2003)
30Oct03
- Integrated Alexander Schremmer's stdout fix for Windows --
  keeps debug printout from being sent to the serial port.
28Oct03
- Bob Kuo found a bug that caused a seg fault for newer USB
  UPSes. The error was that my code walked off the end of a 
  table in linux-usb.c if the USB code was not in the
  table.

--- Release apcupsd-3.10.6 (10 October 2003)
11Oct03
- Release 3.10.6 10Oct03 as offical stable version.
03Oct03
- Move the old manual to old_documents and commit the
  new docbook manual to the CVS. Don't include the web
  html directory.
28Sep03
- Test net slave mode. It works fine.
- Add MASTER name to status output if device is a slave.
- Display last master update if device is a net slave.
- Add 10 sec delay before calling apcupsd --killpower it is
  needed for USB killpower to work right. Why????
- Save old apccontrol when installing a new one.
- Replace old UPS_SET() with set_ups() in a number of places.
27Sep03
- Implement autodetect of USB port if no DEVICE given.
</pre><p>Change Log for version 3.10.6</p><pre class="programlisting">
- Lots of updates to the document.
- Fixed a slave crash in master/slave mode. It was a missing setup_device,
  and was diagnosed and reported by Christian Schacht -- many thanks.
- Made non-existent header files non-fatal and added #ifdef 
  around sys/socket.h so it will compile on IRIX.
- Add Scott's latest apcupsd.conf with the hid-ups program code 
  (actually I had done this some time ago ...).
- Start a ReleaseNotes file
- Fixed a typo error (mine) that prevented Scott from building
  rpms. Strange, it worked for me????
- More DESTDIR cleanup for building non-root rpms.
- Add DESTDIR everywhere so we can build rpms non-root
- Additional documentation
- Add Scott's new apcupsd.spec
- On Hilary Jones suggestion, I fixed the ./configure message that
  is printed when no libgd is found to direct the user to the
  main source.
- Add Sergey Vlasov's kernel patch to the examples directory,
  and it replaces the previous patch.
  This patch now solves the killpower problem on Linux USB.
  &lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/examples/linux-2.4.20-alt-apc_usb_ups.patch
  notes are in: linux-usb-patch-email.txt
- Add TTY mode to apctest to communicated directly with UPS.
- Apply patch to linux-usb.c in killpower supplied by
  Sergey Vlasov (thanks!).
- Eliminate pow() function in linux-usb.c so that -lm is not needed.
- Add automatic detection of socklen_t
- I received a kernel patch from Sergey Vlasov that fixes
  the killpower problem on CS UPSes. apcupsd can now shutdown
  these devices! I've removed some debug code that was in
  the killpower routine and is not needed or used.
  I have put the kernel patch in:
  &lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/examples/linux-2.4.20-alt-hidups.patch
- When the Win32 version starts as a service, delete the
  NOLOGIN and PWRFAIL files to prevent later confusion.
  Thanks to Allen Crawford for pointing this out.
- Modify all Win32 program so that only windowed programs
  (apcupsd, popup) have the -mwindows flags. The others do not.
- Tweak apctest.c a bit -- add EEPROM programming (still a bit
  kludgy), but at least it can be done.
- Lots of clean ups for Cygwin stuff. Events now work, and exit.
- Clean up a few undefined symbols in building with everything on.
- Eliminate pid and serial port lock file on Win32 systems.
- Modify init script to use daemon so that STDIN/OUT, ... are   
  detached from the terminal and pointed to the log file. This
  prevents remotely logged in users who start apcupsd from being
  unable to log out.
- Made some mindor modifications to configure.in and aclocal.m4 to
  make consistent use of double quotes in test statements in
  response to problems with make install reported by Andrew Surratt.
- Thanks to Richard Schwaninger for finding and submitting a patch to
  the tcp-wrappers code that prevented it from working because of an
  invalid name. Fixed.
- Thanks to Andrew Reid for pointing out that the child reaping code
  should be clearing the pid slot if a -1 is returned. The pid table
  was filling up on his system due to killed children. Fixed
- A bug report against the Mandrake version of apcupsd indicates that
  apcupsd is not releasing /dev/console.  I've moved the close() of
  STDIN so that it is always executed to prevent this possibility.
- Implement very crude first cut of EEPROM programming in apctest.
  Set battery date, set UPS name, and print EEPROM values should
  work.

If you have a USB UPS, and a USB-capable recent Linux such as Red Hat

that's an easy setup.  APC supplies the cable needed to talk with 
that UPS along with the UPS. All you need to do is <a href="manual.html#check_usb" title="Checking Out Your USB Subsystem">check that your USB subsystem is working</a>;

the USB code in apcupsd works only on Linux.  Drivers for other
OSes can be written, but it requires someone with a knowledge of
the OS and the USB to do so.  (This lack of a Unix USB API
interface is one of the big failings of Unix.  It occurs in other
areas such as the GUI. Many people tout the diversity as an
advantage, but it is in fact a weakness.)</p><p>The <i class="application">apcupsd</i> maintainers develop it
under Red Hat; that port is, accordingly, the most
up to date and best tested.  There are enough Debian Linux users that
that port is also generally pretty fresh.  Slackware Linux is also
fully supported.</p><p><i class="application">apcupsd</i> has also been ported to
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, HP/UX, Solaris, Alpha Unix and the Cygwin

over a USB wire.  Most of APC's lineup now uses this method as of
late 2003, and it seems likely to completely take over in their
low- and middle range.  Other manufacturers (Belkin, Tripp-Lite,
etc.) are moving the same way, though with a different control
protocol for each manufacturer.  As long as USB hardware can be
mass-produced more cheaply than an Ethernet card, most UPSes are
likely to go this design route. Please note that even if you have
a USB UPS, if you use a serial cable with it (as can be supplied
by APC), you will need to configure your UPS as <span class="bold"><b>apcsmart</b></span>

The table shown below lists the APC model supported, and the possible
kewords that you would use in the configuration with the listed cables.
Some of the models, particularly USB enabled models, can be run in
multiple modes, so they may appear more than once in the table. APC is 
putting out new models at a furious rate, and so it is very likely that
your model is not listed in the table. If it is USB enabled, it will 
probably work in USB mode. Please note that some of these new models
are extremely inexpensive, so they are stripped down versions of more
expensive units, and as such they do not offer as many features, so
some of the example output you see elsewhere in this manual may
not be available with your unit.</p><div class="informaltable"><a name="type_table"></a><table border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th><p><span class="bold"><b>APC Model</b></span></p></th><th><p><span class="emphasis"><em>UPSTYPE Keyword</em></span></p></th><th><p><span class="emphasis"><em>UPSCABLE keywords for Cables Supported</em></span></p></th><th><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Status</em></span></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BackUPS CS/ES (serial mode)</td><td>apcsmart</td><td>smart (note: using Smart Custom RJ45<sup>[<a href="manual.html#ftn.custom_cable">b</a>]</sup>) the

<i class="application">apcupsd</i> on your system. The first is a
standalone configuration where <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
controls a single UPS, which powers a single computer.  This is the most
common configuration.  If you're working with just one machine and one UPS,
skip the rest of this section.</p><p>Your choices become more interesting if you are running a
small cluster or a big server farm.  Under those circumstances, it 
may not be possible or even desirable to pair a UPS with every single
machine.  <i class="application">apcupsd</i> supports some alternate
arrangements.</p><p>The second type of configuration is a master/slave
configuration, where one UPS powers several computers, each of which
runs a copy of <i class="application">apcupsd</i>. The computer that
controls the UPS is called the master, and the other computers are
called slaves. The master copy of <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
communicates with and controls the slaves via an Ethernet connection.
This type of configuration may be appropriate for a small cluster
of machines. Some example configuration files for the master and the
slave machines can be found in the <i class="application">examples</i> 
directory of the source distribution. The more recent examples are in
<i class="application">master.apcupsd.conf</i> and 
<i class="application">slave.apcupsd.conf</i>. </p><p>The third configuration (new with version 3.8.3), is where
a single computer controls multiple UPSes. In this case, there are
several copies of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> on the same
computer, each controlling a different UPS. One copy of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> will run in standalone mode, and
the other copy or copies will normally run in master/slave
mode.  This type of configuration may be appropriate for large
server farms that use one dedicated machine for monitoring 
and diagnostics</p><p>Here is a diagram that summarizes the possibilities:</p><div class="figure"><a name="configtypes"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nspb;&nspb;1.1.&nspb;&nspb;Configuration types.</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="357"><tr style="height: 727px"><td><img src="main_configs.png" width="357" alt="Configuration types." /></td></tr></table></div></div><p>If you decide to set up one of these more complex

building and installing.</p><p>If it doesn't show, check the obvious things; the UPS must be
powered on, and a cable must be properly seated in both the data port
of the UPS and one of your machine's USB ports.  Many UPSes have phone
ports to provide surge protection for phones or modems — make
sure you haven't plugged your USB cable into one of those rather than
the data port (which will usually be near the top edge of the
case.)</p><p>Note, on recent Debian systems, they do not include 
the hiddev device nodes in /dev, so you may need to manually
create them using the <span class="bold"><b>examples/make-hiddev</b></span> script.</p><p>Also, ensure that the correct drivers are loaded. Under Linux-2.4.x,
you can check this out easily by examining the right file in the
<tt class="filename">/proc</tt> system.  Here's how you can do that:</p><pre class="screen">
esr@grelber$ cat /proc/bus/usb/drivers</pre><p>and you should get:</p><pre class="screen">
         usbdevfs
         hub
 96-111: hiddev
         hid
</pre><p>
On Linux-2.6.x, make sure the sysfs filesystem is mounted on /sys
and do:
</p><pre class="screen">
adk0212@mail$ ls -l /sys/bus/usb/drivers/</pre><p>where you should get</p><pre class="screen">
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 May  1 18:55 hid

    drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 May  1 18:55 hub

    drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root            0 May  1 18:55 usbfs
</pre><p>
If your 2.6.x system does not have the /sys/bus/usb
directory, either you do not have sysfs mounted on /sys or the USB
module(s) have not been loaded.  (Check /proc/mounts to make sure
sysfs is mounted.)
</p><p>A USB UPS needs all of these drivers — the USB device filesystem,
the USB hub, the Human Interface Device subsystem driver, and the
Human Interface Device driver.             
If you are compiling your own kernel, you want to enable
CONFIG_USB, CONFIG_USB_HID, CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV, and
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS as well as at least one USB Host Controller
Driver (CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD [2.6.x], CONFIG_USB_UHCI [2.4.x],
etc.).
</p><p>
If CONFIG_USB is set as M, CONFIG_USB_HID must be M (if enabled
at all). If CONFIG_USB is set as Y, CONFIG_USB_HID can be M or
Y. hiddev, in turn, will be built however HID is.</p><p>
Some kernels ship, such as Mandrake 10, ship with 
CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS turned on. This is not ideal for
running with apcupsd, and the easiest solution is to 
turn CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS off and rebuild your
kernel, or find a pre-built kernel with it off.
For a kernel with CONFIG_USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS turned on to
work with apcupsd, you must enable <span class="bold"><b>devfs</b></span>. The following
will tell you if devfs is enabled:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ ps ax | grep devs
</pre><p>
which should give something like the following:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
533 ?        S      0:00 devfsd /dev
</pre><p>
What complicates the situation much more on Mandrake kernels is
their security level since CONFIG_DYNAMIC_USB_MINORS is turned
on, but on higher security levels devfs is turned off. The net
result, is that in those situations hiddev is hosed (to use
Adam's terms) so apcupsd will not work.
So, in these cases, the choices are:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
(a) Reduce the security level setting of the system 
    (not sure if this is possible after the initial install).
(b) Custom build a high security kernel with devfs enabled 
    and make sure devfs is mounted and devfsd is running.
(c) Custom build a high security kernel with dynamic 
    minors disabled
(d) Use udev
</pre><p>
For a typical USB section of a kernel .config file, please
see the end of this section.
</p><p>For the IOGear serial USB connection, you need:</p><pre class="programlisting">
usbcore
usbserial
pl2303
</pre><p>Finally, check that appropriate USB devices exist.  On a Red Hat
system you can do this:</p><pre class="screen">
esr@grelber$ ls /dev/usb/h*
/dev/usb/hiddev0   /dev/usb/hiddev12  /dev/usb/hiddev2  /dev/usb/hiddev6

/dev/usb/hiddev11  /dev/usb/hiddev15  /dev/usb/hiddev5  /dev/usb/hiddev9
</pre><p>This will tell you that the Human Interface Device nodes, one of
which <i class="application">apcupsd</i> will use to talk with the
UPS, exist.  On other Linuxes the layout will be slightly different;
the hiddev devices will usually live in a
<tt class="filename">/dev/usb/hid/</tt> subdirectory. If these devices
don't exist, you may need to run
<tt class="filename">&lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/examples/make-hiddev</tt> to
create them.</p><p>Now build and run the <i class="application">hid-ups</i> test
program. You do not have to configure and build the rest of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to do this.  To build
<i class="application">hid-ups</i> enter:</p><pre class="programlisting">
cd &lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/examples
make hid-ups
</pre><p>There should be no errors. Now assuming that everything has gone
well to this point and that you have connected your USB UPS, enter:</p><pre class="programlisting">
./hid-ups
</pre><p>It should print a sample report of the information that it has
obtained from your UPS. CAUTION! if you have a 2.4.x Linux kernel
do  not run two copies of this program
at the same time, or your kernel will freeze. The report that is
printed should look very similar to the report in
<tt class="filename">&lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/examples/hid-ups.rpt</tt>. If the program reports
that the device was not found ensure that all the appropriate modules
are loaded (as described earlier), then unplug your UPS and plug it
back in. This should permit the kernel to recognize the UPS.</p><p>If <i class="application">./hid-ups</i> tells you &quot;No
permission, try this as root&quot;, you know what to try. If it says
&quot;Couldn't find USB UPS device, check your /dev.&quot;, then it is
very unlikely that <i class="application">apcupsd</i> will work.  You
probably need to run the script &quot;make-hiddev&quot; before
continuing.</p><p>If all there things check out and you still can't see the UPS,
something is more seriously wrong than this manual can cover —
find expert help.  If you are unable to list USB devices or drivers,
you kernel may not be USB-capable and that needs to be fixed.
Please check if your kernel has the three patches listed in
the <tt class="filename">&lt;apcupsd-source&gt;/examples</tt> directory.
Each of the files ends with the name <tt class="filename">.patch</tt>, and at the
current writing they are:</p><pre class="programlisting">
linux-2.4.20-killpower.patch
linux-2.4.20-USB-reject.patch
linux-2.6.0-USB-queue-overflow.patch
</pre><p>
For example, RedHat 9 and/or pre-2.4.22 kernels are known to need the
linux-2.4.20-USB-reject.patch
for APC SmartUPS XL series devices.
</p><p>
There are also a few email files that you can consult in the <tt class="filename">examples</tt>
directory for additional information and details.

Interpretation of /proc/usb info on 2.4 kernels:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/proc/bus/usb filesystem output
===============================
(version 2002.03.18)


The /proc filesystem for USB devices provides /proc/bus/usb/drivers
and /proc/bus/usb/devices, as well as /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD files.


**NOTE**: If /proc/bus/usb appears empty, and a host controller
          driver has been linked, then you need to mount the
          filesystem.  Issue the command (as root):

      mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

          An alternative and more permanent method would be to add

      none  /proc/bus/usb  usbfs  defaults  0  0

          to /etc/fstab.  This will mount usbfs at each reboot.
          You can then issue `cat /proc/bus/usb/devices` to extract
          USB device information, and user mode drivers can use usbfs 
          to interact with USB devices.

          There are a number of mount options supported by usbfs.
          Consult the source code (linux/drivers/usb/inode.c) for
          information about those options.

**NOTE**: The filesystem has been renamed from &quot;usbdevfs&quot; to
          &quot;usbfs&quot;, to reduce confusion with &quot;devfs&quot;.  You may
          still see references to the older &quot;usbdevfs&quot; name.

For more information on mounting the usbfs file system, see the
&quot;USB Device Filesystem&quot; section of the USB Guide. The latest copy 
of the USB Guide can be found at http://www.linux-usb.org/


THE /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD FILES:
--------------------------------
Each connected USB device has one file.  The BBB indicates the bus
number.  The DDD indicates the device address on that bus.  Both
of these numbers are assigned sequentially, and can be reused, so
you can't rely on them for stable access to devices.  For example,
it's relatively common for devices to re-enumerate while they are
still connected (perhaps someone jostled their power supply, hub,
or USB cable), so a device might be 002/027 when you first connect
it and 002/048 sometime later.

These files can be read as binary data.  The binary data consists
of first the device descriptor, then the descriptors for each
configuration of the device.  That information is also shown in
text form by the /proc/bus/usb/devices file, described later.

These files may also be used to write user-level drivers for the USB
devices.  You would open the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD file read/write,
read its descriptors to make sure it's the device you expect, and then
bind to an interface (or perhaps several) using an ioctl call.  You
would issue more ioctls to the device to communicate to it using
control, bulk, or other kinds of USB transfers.  The IOCTLs are
listed in the <span class="bold"><b>linux/usbdevice_fs.h</b></span> file, and at this writing the
source code (linux/drivers/usb/devio.c) is the primary reference
for how to access devices through those files.

Note that since by default these BBB/DDD files are writable only by
root, only root can write such user mode drivers.  You can selectively
grant read/write permissions to other users by using &quot;chmod&quot;.  Also,
usbfs mount options such as &quot;devmode=0666&quot; may be helpful.



THE /proc/bus/usb/drivers FILE:
-------------------------------
Each of the USB device drivers linked into your kernel (statically,
or dynamically using &quot;modprobe&quot;) is listed in the &quot;drivers&quot; file.
Here's an example from one system:

         usbdevfs
         hub
  0- 15: usblp
         usbnet
         serial
         usb-storage
         pegasus

If you see this file, &quot;usbdevfs&quot; and &quot;hub&quot; will always be listed,
since those are part of the &quot;usbcore&quot; framework.

Drivers that use the USB major number (180) to provide character devices
will include a range of minor numbers, as shown above for the &quot;usblp&quot;
(actually &quot;printer.o&quot;) module.  USB device drivers can of course use any
major number, but it's easy to use the USB range since there's explicit
support for subdividing it in the USB device driver framework.


THE /proc/bus/usb/devices FILE:
-------------------------------
In /proc/bus/usb/devices, each device's output has multiple
lines of ASCII output.
I made it ASCII instead of binary on purpose, so that someone
can obtain some useful data from it without the use of an
auxiliary program.  However, with an auxiliary program, the numbers
in the first 4 columns of each &quot;T:&quot; line (topology info:
Lev, Prnt, Port, Cnt) can be used to build a USB topology diagram.

Each line is tagged with a one-character ID for that line:

T = Topology (etc.)
B = Bandwidth (applies only to USB host controllers, which are
    virtualized as root hubs)
D = Device descriptor info.
P = Product ID info. (from Device descriptor, but they won't fit
    together on one line)
S = String descriptors.
C = Configuration descriptor info. (* = active configuration)
I = Interface descriptor info.
E = Endpoint descriptor info.

=======================================================================

/proc/bus/usb/devices output format:

Legend:
  d = decimal number (may have leading spaces or 0's)
  x = hexadecimal number (may have leading spaces or 0's)
  s = string

    90% of the bus bandwidth is reserved.  For a high speed bus (loosely,

|__Config info tag
    
    USB devices may have multiple configurations, each of which act
    rather differently.  For example, a bus-powered configuration
    might be much less capable than one that is self-powered.  Only
    one device configuration can be active at a time; most devices
    have only one configuration.

    Each configuration consists of one or more interfaces.  Each
    interface serves a distinct &quot;function&quot;, which is typically bound
    to a different USB device driver.  One common example is a USB
    speaker with an audio interface for playback, and a HID interface
    for use with software volume control.


Interface descriptor info (can be multiple per Config):

I:  If#=dd Alt=dd #EPs=dd Cls=xx(sssss) Sub=xx Prot=xx Driver=ssss
|   |      |      |       |             |      |       |__Driver name

|   |      |      |__NumberOfEndpoints
|   |      |__AlternateSettingNumber
|   |__InterfaceNumber
|__Interface info tag

    A given interface may have one or more &quot;alternate&quot; settings.
    For example, default settings may not use more than a small
    amount of periodic bandwidth.  To use significant fractions
    of bus bandwidth, drivers must select a non-default altsetting.
    
    Only one setting for an interface may be active at a time, and
    only one driver may bind to an interface at a time.  Most devices
    have only one alternate setting per interface.


Endpoint descriptor info (can be multiple per Interface):

E:  Ad=xx(s) Atr=xx(ssss) MxPS=dddd Ivl=dddms
|   |        |            |         |__Interval (max) between transfers
|   |        |            |__EndpointMaxPacketSize
|   |        |__Attributes(EndpointType)
|   |__EndpointAddress(I=In,O=Out)
|__Endpoint info tag

    The interval is nonzero for all periodic (interrupt or isochronous)
    endpoints.  For high speed endpoints the transfer interval may be
    measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds.

    For high speed periodic endpoints, the &quot;MaxPacketSize&quot; reflects
    the per-microframe data transfer size.  For &quot;high bandwidth&quot;
    endpoints, that can reflect two or three packets (for up to
    3KBytes every 125 usec) per endpoint.

    With the Linux-USB stack, periodic bandwidth reservations use the
    transfer intervals and sizes provided by URBs, which can be less
    than those found in endpoint descriptor.


=======================================================================


If a user or script is interested only in Topology info, for
example, use something like &quot;grep ^T: /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot;
for only the Topology lines.  A command like
&quot;grep -i ^[tdp]: /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot; can be used to list
only the lines that begin with the characters in square brackets,
where the valid characters are TDPCIE.  With a slightly more able
script, it can display any selected lines (for example, only T, D,
and P lines) and change their output format.  (The &quot;procusb&quot;
Perl script is the beginning of this idea.  It will list only
selected lines [selected from TBDPSCIE] or &quot;All&quot; lines from
/proc/bus/usb/devices.)

The Topology lines can be used to generate a graphic/pictorial
of the USB devices on a system's root hub.  (See more below
on how to do this.)

The Interface lines can be used to determine what driver is
being used for each device.

The Configuration lines could be used to list maximum power
(in milliamps) that a system's USB devices are using.
For example, &quot;grep ^C: /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot;.


Here's an example, from a system which has a UHCI root hub,
an external hub connected to the root hub, and a mouse and
a serial converter connected to the external hub.

Selecting only the &quot;T:&quot; and &quot;I:&quot; lines from this (for example, by using
&quot;procusb ti&quot;), we have:

I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 3 Cls=00(&gt;ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=serial


Physically this looks like (or could be converted to):

/proc/bus/usb filesystem output
===============================
(version 2003.05.30)


The usbfs filesystem for USB devices is traditionally mounted at
/proc/bus/usb.  It provides the /proc/bus/usb/devices file, as well as
the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD files.


**NOTE**: If /proc/bus/usb appears empty, and a host controller
          driver has been linked, then you need to mount the
          filesystem.  Issue the command (as root):

      mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

          An alternative and more permanent method would be to add

      none  /proc/bus/usb  usbfs  defaults  0  0

          to /etc/fstab.  This will mount usbfs at each reboot.
          You can then issue `cat /proc/bus/usb/devices` to extract
          USB device information, and user mode drivers can use usbfs 
          to interact with USB devices.

          There are a number of mount options supported by usbfs.
          Consult the source code (linux/drivers/usb/core/inode.c) for
          information about those options.

**NOTE**: The filesystem has been renamed from &quot;usbdevfs&quot; to
          &quot;usbfs&quot;, to reduce confusion with &quot;devfs&quot;.  You may
          still see references to the older &quot;usbdevfs&quot; name.

For more information on mounting the usbfs file system, see the
&quot;USB Device Filesystem&quot; section of the USB Guide. The latest copy 
of the USB Guide can be found at http://www.linux-usb.org/


THE /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD FILES:
--------------------------------
Each connected USB device has one file.  The BBB indicates the bus
number.  The DDD indicates the device address on that bus.  Both
of these numbers are assigned sequentially, and can be reused, so
you can't rely on them for stable access to devices.  For example,
it's relatively common for devices to re-enumerate while they are
still connected (perhaps someone jostled their power supply, hub,
or USB cable), so a device might be 002/027 when you first connect
it and 002/048 sometime later.

These files can be read as binary data.  The binary data consists
of first the device descriptor, then the descriptors for each
configuration of the device.  That information is also shown in
text form by the /proc/bus/usb/devices file, described later.

These files may also be used to write user-level drivers for the USB
devices.  You would open the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD file read/write,
read its descriptors to make sure it's the device you expect, and then
bind to an interface (or perhaps several) using an ioctl call.  You
would issue more ioctls to the device to communicate to it using
control, bulk, or other kinds of USB transfers.  The IOCTLs are
listed in the <span class="bold"><b>linux/usbdevice_fs.h</b></span> file, and at this writing the
source code (linux/drivers/usb/devio.c) is the primary reference
for how to access devices through those files.

Note that since by default these BBB/DDD files are writable only by
root, only root can write such user mode drivers.  You can selectively
grant read/write permissions to other users by using &quot;chmod&quot;.  Also,
usbfs mount options such as &quot;devmode=0666&quot; may be helpful.



THE /proc/bus/usb/devices FILE:
-------------------------------
In /proc/bus/usb/devices, each device's output has multiple
lines of ASCII output.
I made it ASCII instead of binary on purpose, so that someone
can obtain some useful data from it without the use of an
auxiliary program.  However, with an auxiliary program, the numbers
in the first 4 columns of each &quot;T:&quot; line (topology info:
Lev, Prnt, Port, Cnt) can be used to build a USB topology diagram.

Each line is tagged with a one-character ID for that line:

T = Topology (etc.)
B = Bandwidth (applies only to USB host controllers, which are
    virtualized as root hubs)
D = Device descriptor info.
P = Product ID info. (from Device descriptor, but they won't fit
    together on one line)
S = String descriptors.
C = Configuration descriptor info. (* = active configuration)
I = Interface descriptor info.
E = Endpoint descriptor info.

|__Interface info tag

    A given interface may have one or more &quot;alternate&quot; settings.
    For example, default settings may not use more than a small
    amount of periodic bandwidth.  To use significant fractions
    of bus bandwidth, drivers must select a non-default altsetting.
    
    Only one setting for an interface may be active at a time, and
    only one driver may bind to an interface at a time.  Most devices
    have only one alternate setting per interface.


Endpoint descriptor info (can be multiple per Interface):

E:  Ad=xx(s) Atr=xx(ssss) MxPS=dddd Ivl=dddss
|   |        |            |         |__Interval (max) between transfers

|   |        |__Attributes(EndpointType)
|   |__EndpointAddress(I=In,O=Out)
|__Endpoint info tag

    The interval is nonzero for all periodic (interrupt or isochronous)
    endpoints.  For high speed endpoints the transfer interval may be
    measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds.

    For high speed periodic endpoints, the &quot;MaxPacketSize&quot; reflects
    the per-microframe data transfer size.  For &quot;high bandwidth&quot;
    endpoints, that can reflect two or three packets (for up to
    3KBytes every 125 usec) per endpoint.

    With the Linux-USB stack, periodic bandwidth reservations use the
    transfer intervals and sizes provided by URBs, which can be less
    than those found in endpoint descriptor.


=======================================================================


If a user or script is interested only in Topology info, for
example, use something like &quot;grep ^T: /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot;
for only the Topology lines.  A command like
&quot;grep -i ^[tdp]: /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot; can be used to list
only the lines that begin with the characters in square brackets,
where the valid characters are TDPCIE.  With a slightly more able
script, it can display any selected lines (for example, only T, D,
and P lines) and change their output format.  (The &quot;procusb&quot;
Perl script is the beginning of this idea.  It will list only
selected lines [selected from TBDPSCIE] or &quot;All&quot; lines from
/proc/bus/usb/devices.)

The Topology lines can be used to generate a graphic/pictorial
of the USB devices on a system's root hub.  (See more below
on how to do this.)

The Interface lines can be used to determine what driver is
being used for each device.

The Configuration lines could be used to list maximum power
(in milliamps) that a system's USB devices are using.
For example, &quot;grep ^C: /proc/bus/usb/devices&quot;.


Here's an example, from a system which has a UHCI root hub,
an external hub connected to the root hub, and a mouse and
a serial converter connected to the external hub.

Selecting only the &quot;T:&quot; and &quot;I:&quot; lines from this (for example, by using

available in binary RPM format.  This is the simplest way to install.
If you have no previous version of <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
on your machine and are creating a standalone configuration, simply
install the RPM with a normal <b class="command">rpm -ihv</b> command.
You're done, and can now skip the rest of this chapter and go straight
to <a href="manual.html#after_installation" title="Chapter&#xA0;3.&#xA0;After Installation">tweaking your run-time
configuration file.</a></p><p>If you have a previous installation, you can upgrade with a normal
<b class="command">rpm -Uhv</b>, but this may not upgrade the halt script.
It may be better to do the upgrade as a remove (<b class="command">rpm -e</b>)
foll;owed by a fresh install (<b class="command">rpm -ihv</b>).</p><p>After installation of the binary RPM, please verify carefully
that <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</tt> was properly updated
and contains new script lines flagged with <span class="bold"><b>***APCUPSD***</b></span>.</p><p>Since there is no standard location for
<tt class="filename">cgi-bin</tt>, the rpm will place the binary CGI
programs in the directory <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/cgi</tt>. To
actually use them, you must copy or move them to your actual cgi-bin
directory, which on many systems is located in
<tt class="filename">/home/httpd/cgi-bin</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2868021"></a>Microsoft Windows</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>If you have a binary release of the <i class="application">Win32

depending on what system you are running. The basic procedure involves

correctly determine which operating system you are running and
configure the source code appropriately. <b class="command">configure</b>
currently recognizes the systems listed below in the <a href="manual.html#OS_Specifics" title="Operating System Specifics">the section called “Operating System Specifics”</a> section of this chapter and adapts the
configuration appropriately.  Check that the configuration report
printed at the end of the <b class="command">configure</b> process
corresponds to your choice of directories, options, and that it has
correctly detected your operating system.  If not, redo the
<b class="command">configure</b> with the appropriate options until your
configuration is correct.</p><p>Please note that a number of the <b class="command">configure</b>
options preset <tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> directive values in
an attempt to automatically adapt <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
as best possible to your system.  You can change the values in
<tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> at a later time without redoing the
configuration process by simply editing the
<tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> file.</p><p>Other configuration options can be used to set up the installation
of HTML documentation and optional modules, notably the CGI interface
that enables the UPS state to be queried via the Web and the 
optional <i class="application">powerflute</i> curses-based control
panel.  Still others enable features such as thread support.  You 
will find a complete reference later in this chapter.</p><p>In general, you will probably want to supply a more elaborate
<b class="command">configure</b> statement to ensure that the modules you
want are built and that everything is placed into the correct
directories.</p><p>On Red Hat, a fairly typical configuration command would
look like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
CFLAGS=&quot;-g -O2&quot; LDFLAGS=&quot;-g&quot; ./configure \
  --enable-usb \
  --with-serial-dev=/dev/usb/hiddev[0-15] \

  --with-upscable=usb \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --sbindir=/sbin \
  --with-cgi-bin=/var/www/cgi-bin \
  --enable-cgi \
  --with-css-dir=/var/www/docs/css \
  --with-log-dir=/etc/apcupsd \
  --enable-pthreads \
  --enable-powerflute
</pre><p>On other Linux systems, the <tt class="option">--with-serial-dev</tt>
may need to be <tt class="filename">/dev/usb/hid/hiddev[0-15]</tt>.
The <span class="bold"><b>[0-15]</b></span> is not a typo, but should
be entered exactly as shown. This is because the UPS can change device
numbers while it is running. Every time there is a blip or slowdown on
the USB line, the kernel will invalidate the UPS connection, then a
few moments later, it will reconnect but with a different device
number. Not very Unix-like, but that is what happens. This bizarre
syntax allows <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to try a range of
devices until it finds or re-finds the UPS device.</p><p>By default, <b class="command">make install</b> will install the
executable files in <tt class="filename">/sbin</tt>, the manuals in
<tt class="filename">/usr/man</tt>, and the configuration and script files
in <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd</tt>. In addition, if your system is
recognized, certain files such as the startup script and the system
halt script will be placed in appropriate system directories (usually
subdirectories of <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d</tt>).</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2868454"></a>Verifying a Source Installation</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>There are a number of things that you can do to check if the
installation (make install) went well. The fist is to check where the
system has installed <i class="application">apcupsd</i> using
<b class="command">which</b> and <b class="command">whereis</b>. On my Red Hat
system, you should get the following (lines preceded with a $ indicate what
you type):</p><pre class="screen">
$ which apcupsd 
/sbin/apcupsd
$ whereis apcupsd
apcupsd: /sbin/apcupsd /etc/apcupsd /etc/apcupsd.conf
/etc/apcupsd.status /usr/man/man8/apcupsd.8.gz
/usr/man/man8/apcupsd.8
</pre><p>If you find an <i class="application">apcupsd</i> in
<tt class="filename">/usr/sbin</tt>, <tt class="filename">/usr/local/sbin</tt>,
<tt class="filename">/usr/lib</tt>, or another such directory, it is
probably a piece of an old version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> that you can delete. If you are in
doubt, delete it, then rerun the <b class="command">make install</b> to
ensure that you haven't deleted anything needed by the new
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>.  Please note that the files
specified above assume the default installation locations.</p><p>As a final check that the <b class="command">make install</b> went
well, you should check your halt script (in
<tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d</tt> on SUSE systems, and in
<tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d</tt> on Red Hat systems) to see that
the appropriate lines have been inserted in the correct
place. Modification of the halt script is important so that at the end
of the shutdown procedure, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> will be
called again to command the UPS to turn off the power. This should
only be done in a power failure situation as indicated by the presence
of the <tt class="filename">/etc/powerfail</tt> file, and is necessary if
you want your machine to automatically be restarted when the power
returns. On a Red Hat system, the lines containing the <b class="command">#
***apcupsd***</b> should be inserted just before the final halt
command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
# Remount read only anything that's left mounted.
#echo &quot;Remounting remaining filesystems (if any) readonly&quot;
mount | awk '/ext2/ { print $3 }' | while read line; do
    mount -n -o ro,remount $line
done

# See if this is a powerfail situation.                               # ***apcupsd***
if [ -f /etc/apcupsd/powerfail ]; then                                # ***apcupsd***
   echo                                                               # ***apcupsd***

 echo &quot;On the next boot fsck will be skipped.&quot;

fi
</pre><p>The purpose of modifying the system halt files is so that
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> will be recalled after the system
is in a stable state. At that point,
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> will instruct the UPS to shut off
the power. This is necessary if you wish your system to automatically
reboot when the mains power is restored. If you prefer to manually
reboot your system, you can skip this final system dependent
installation step by specifying the
<tt class="option">disable-install-distdir</tt> option on the
<b class="command">./configure</b> command (see below for more
details).</p><p>The above pertains to Red Hat systems only. There are significant
differences in the procedures on each system, as well as the location
of the halt script. Also, the information that is inserted in your
halt script varies from system to system. Other systems such as
Solaris require you the make the changes manually, which has the
advantage that you won't have any unpleasant surprises in your halt
script should things go wrong. Please consult the specific system
dependent README files for more details.</p><p>Please note that if you install from RPMs for a slave machine,
you will need to remove the changes that the RPM install script made
(similar to what is noted above) to the halt script. This is because
on a slave machine there is no connection to the UPS, so there is no
need to attempt to power off the UPS. That will be done by the
master.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2868720"></a>Configure Options</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>All the available <b class="command">configure</b> options can be

As of
version 3.8.3, we do not recommend that you compile
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> with pthreads enabled. This is
because the current FreeBSD implementation of pthreads runs as a
single process, and thus is less efficient (consumes more CPU time)
than the forking version of <i class="application">apcupsd</i>. We
hope to rectify this in a future version by using the FreeBSD
LinuxThreads implementation of pthreads.</p><p>On the FreeBSD OS, there is no known way for a user program to
get control when all the disks are synced. This is needed for
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to be able to issue the killpower
command to the UPS so that the UPS shuts off the power. To accomplish
the same thing on FreeBSD systems, make sure you have a SmartUPS and
that your UPS shutdown grace period is set sufficiently long so that
you system will power down (usually 2 minutes), the use the
<tt class="option">kill-on-powerfail</tt> option on the
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> command line.</p><p>Please note the concerns listed below under OpenBSD concerning

<tt class="filename">distributions/openbsd/README</tt> file before running
apcupsd. There are some critical differences in how the OpenBSD
implementation operates when the UPS batteries are exhausted. Failure
to take this into account may result in the system not being fully
halted when power is lost.  Please read the comments on the pthreads
implementation in the FreeBSD section above as they may apply equally
to OpenBSD.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE. Due to some deficiencies or errors in the OpenBSD
pthreads libraries, if you build apcupsd on OpenBSD with pthread and a
child program is launched (i.e. mail notification of events), this may
cause OpenBSD to freeze up. The best solution is probably to build 
without pthread. However, in doing so, you must realize that the bulk 
of this manual assumes that pthreads is enabled, and thus many of
the comments about <i class="application">apcaccess</i> will not
be applicable. A second solution that seems to work is to delete
all calls to the email notification routines from 
<tt class="filename">apccontrol</tt>. In doing so, some users have succeeded
in running apcupsd with pthreads.</p><p>If you want to know the technical problems with pthreads on
OpenBSD, it is as best we can tell because the pthreads are not
real kernel pthreads as on Linux and Solaris, but rather a user
program that makes all I/O non-blocking. So when apcupds does I/O,
the userland pthreads libarary will switch to another thread if it
wants to run. This works fine except that when a child process is
called and it exits, all the blocking/non-blocking statuses of
the open file descriptors in the parent program are reset as 
blocking -- this causes chaos and an almost immediate freezing
of the program (apcupsd). </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="RedHat"></a>Red Hat Systems</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Red Hat systems are fully supported, and by following the

backups of any critical information before you install this
software.</p><p>Remember, we told you. we'll listen sympathetically if you lose
data, but there will be nothing we can do to help you.</p><p>Please read the general installation instructions given above
before continuing on with these Solaris-specific instructions. Then
come back and read this section before attempting to build the
package.</p><p>For building the system, we suggest that you run the configure
and make processes as your normal UNIX user ID. The <b class="command">make
install</b> must be run as root. But if your normal ID has an
environment setup for using the C compiler, it's simpler to do that
than to set up root to have the correct environment.</p><p>Normally, we support the GCC compiler, but we have also
attempted to support the Solaris workshop compilers and EGCS
compilers. Please be aware that if you do not use GCC, you may
experience a few problems.</p><p>Whichever compiler you do have, please insure that you can
execute the compiler from the command line before running
configure. If you do not have an environment setup to run the
compiler first, configure will fail.</p><p>Before running <b class="command">./configure</b>, please be sure
that you do not have <tt class="filename">/usr/ucb</tt> on your path. This
may cause the <b class="command">./configure</b> to choose the wrong
shutdown program. If <b class="command">./configure</b> detects that
/usr/usb is on your path, it will print a warning message. Please
follow the advice to avoid shutdown problems.</p><p>Your normal UNIX user ID must own the source tree directories, and
you must have the normal development tools in your path. This
includes make, the compiler, the M4 preprocessor, the linker, and
ar or ranlib. If the user you are logged in as can compile and link
a C program from a source file, then you have all the required
tools available.</p><p>You will want to install the executables in a directory that
remains mounted during the shutdown. Solaris will unmount almost
everything except the root directories. Since the ability to power the
UPS off requires access to the executable programs, they need to be in
a directory that will never be unmounted. And since they should also
be in a directory that normal users cannot get into,
<tt class="filename">/sbin</tt> is the default. However, please be aware
that if you want to follow Sun's filesystem conventions you would use
the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
./configure \
   --prefix=/opt/apcupsd \
   --sbindir=/etc/opt/apcupsd/sbin \
   --sysconfdir=/etc/opt/apcupsd \
   --with-cgi-bin=/opt/apcupsd/cgi-bin
</pre><p>The way to setup the <tt class="filename">/sbin</tt> directory as the
executables directory is to pass configure the <span class="bold"><b>sbindir=/sbin</b></span> option. No other arguments
should be required, and your setup and platform should be detected
automatically by configure.</p><p>Once you have run configure, you will need to do a
<b class="command">make</b>.  Once the make has completed with no errors,
you must su to root to complete the install. After the su, you may not
have a path to the make program anymore. In that case, you should do
the <b class="command">make install</b> step as:</p><pre class="programlisting">
/usr/ccs/bin/make install
</pre><p>Once the install completes, you must edit the /sbin/rc0 script as
detailed below, then exit from the su'ed shell.</p><p>In order to support unattended operation and shutdown during a
power failure, it's important that the UPS remove power after the
shutdown completes. This allows the unattended UPS to reboot the
system when power returns by re-powering the system. Of course, you
need autoboot enabled for your system to do this, but all Solaris
systems have this by default. If you have disabled this on your
system, please re-enable it.</p><p>To get the UPS to remove power from the system at the correct
time during shutdown, i.e., after the disks have done their final
sync, we need to modify a system script. This script is
<tt class="filename">/sbin/rc0</tt>.</p><p>We do not have access to every version of Solaris, but we
believe this file will be almost identical on every version. Please
let us know if this is not true.</p><p>At the very end of the <tt class="filename">/sbin/rc0</tt> script,
you should find lines just like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
# unmount file systems. /usr, /var and /var/adm are not unmounted by umountall
# because they are mounted by rcS (for single user mode) rather than
# mountall.
# If this is changed, mountall, umountall and rcS should also change.
/sbin/umountall
/sbin/umount /var/adm &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
/sbin/umount /var &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
/sbin/umount /usr &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

echo 'The system is down.'
</pre><p>We need to insert the following lines just before the last 'echo':</p><pre class="programlisting">
#see if this is a powerfail situation
if [ -f /etc/apcupsd/powerfail ]; then
        echo 
        echo &quot;APCUPSD will power off the UPS&quot;
        echo
        /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol killpower
        echo
        echo &quot;Please ensure that the UPS has powered off before rebooting&quot;
        echo &quot;Otherwise, the UPS may cut the power during the reboot!!!&quot;
        echo
fi
</pre><p>We have included these lines in a file called
<tt class="filename">rc0.solaris</tt> in the distributions/sun subdirectory
of the source tree. You can cut and paste them into the /sbin/rc0 file
at the correct place, or yank and put them using vi or any other
editor. Note that you must be root to edit this file.</p><p>You must be absolutely sure you have them in the right place. If
your <tt class="filename">/sbin/rc0</tt> file does not look like the lines
shown above, do not modify the file. Instead, email a copy of the file
to the maintainers, and we will attempt to figure out what you should
do. If you mess up this file, the system will not shut down cleanly,
and you could lose data. Don't take the chance.</p><p>This feature has only been tested with APC SmartUPS models. If
you do not have a SmartUPS, you will be one of the first testers to
try this feature. Please send email to let us know if it works with
your UPS model, what model you have, and if possible, the event logs
located in <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd</tt>. We'd be very interested
in your results, and would be glad to work with you to get this
feature working correctly with all the APC models. A detailed
description of the screen output during the shutdown would be very
helpful if you see problems.</p><p>You will then need to make the normal changes to the
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</tt> file. This file
contains the configuration settings for the package. It is important
that you set the values to match your UPS model and cable type, and
the serial port that you have attached the UPS to.  People have used both
<tt class="filename">/dev/ttya</tt> and <tt class="filename">/dev/ttyb</tt> with
no problems. You should be sure that logins are disabled on the port
you are going to use, otherwise you will not be able to communicate
with the UPS. If you are not sure that logins are disabled for the
port, run the 'admintool' program as root, and disable the port. The
'admintool' program is a GUI administration program, and required that
you are running CDE, OpenWindows, or another XWindows program such as
KDE.</p><p>Solaris probes the serial ports during boot, and during this
process, it toggles some handshaking lines used by dumb UPSes. As a
result, particularly for simple signalling &quot;dumb&quot; UPSes it seems to
kick it into a mode that makes the UPS think it's either in a
calibration run, or some self-test mode. Since at this point we are
really not communicating with the UPS, it's pretty hard to tell
what happened. But it's easy to prevent this, and you should.
Disconnect the UPS, and boot the system. When you get to a login
prompt, log in as root. Type the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
eeprom com1-noprobe=true
</pre><p>or</p><pre class="programlisting">
eeprom com2-noprobe=true
</pre><p>depending on which com port your UPS is attached to. Then sync and
shutdown the system normally, reattach the UPS, and reboot. This
should solve the problem. However, we have some reports that recent
versions of Solaris (7 &amp; 8) appear to have removed this eeprom
option and there seems to be no way to suppress the serial port
probing during boot.</p><p>At this point, you should have a complete installation. The
daemon will load automatically at the next boot. Watch for any error
messages during boot, and check the event logs in
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd</tt>. If everything looks OK, you can try
testing the package by removing power from the UPS. NOTE! if you have
a voltage-signalling UPS, please run the first power tests with your
computer plugged into the wall rather than into the UPS. This is
because dumb serial-port UPSes have a tendency to power off if your
configuration or cable are not correct.</p><p>As a user, your input is very helpful in solving problems with
the package, and providing suggestions and future directions for the
development of the package. We are striving to provide a useful
package that works across all platforms, and welcome your
feedback.</p><p>Best regards, and thanks for your interest and help, The Apcupsd
Development Team.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="unknown"></a>Unknown System</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>During the <b class="command">./configure</b>, if

directives</a>, but if you are setting up a normal standalone 
configuration you should only need to check (and possibly fix) the
first three items listed below.</p><p>Your UPSTYPE should be the UPS's protocol type: dumb, apcsmart,
usb, net, snmp, or ether.  Your UPSCABLE should be the type of cable you are
using.  You should have gotten both from the <a href="manual.html#type_table">table of types</a>; usually they will both
be the string &quot;usb&quot;.</p><p>If you have a USB device, it is better not to specify a
DEVICE directive by commenting it out. <i class="application">Apcupsd</i> will automatically 
search for your device in the standard places.
If you specify a DEVICE, it should be the name of the device (or device range)
that <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is to use to communicate with
the UPS.  If you're using a USB UPS under Linux, you may leave
the device name field blank and <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
will search all the standard locations for the UPS. You
may also explicitly specify the device location as
either <tt class="filename">/dev/usb/hid/hiddev[0-15]</tt> (on non-Red-Hat
systems) or <tt class="filename">/dev/usb/hiddev[0-15]</tt> (on Red Hat
systems).</p><p>
Note that you should enter &quot;/dev/usb/hiddev[0-15]&quot; literally
as shown.  The &quot;[0-15]&quot; expression tells apcupsd to search all
hiddev devices until it finds a UPS. You can restrict the search to a
subset of devices by using something like &quot;[0-4]&quot;, but keep in
mind this will limit apcupsd's ability to locate the UPS if the kernel
relocates it to a different device node, which happens occasionally during
short power failures.
</p><p>
If the first time you execute <i class="application">apcupsd</i>, you get
a message to the effect that the Apcupsd USB driver is missing, it means
that you most likely forgot to put <span class="emphasis"><em>--enable-usb</em></span> on
your <tt class="filename">./configure</tt> command line. If you loaded        
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> from an rpm file, you may have

power down is to ensure that your computer will automatically reboot
when the power is restored.</p><p>This is not the normal behavior of most computers as shipped
from the factory. Normally after the power is cut and restored, you
must explicitly press a button for the power to actually be turned
on. You can test your computer by powering it down; shutting off the
power (pull the plug); then plugging the cord back in. If your
computer immediately starts up, good. There is nothing more to
do.</p><p>If your computer does not start up, manually turn on the
power (by pressing the power on button) and enter your computer's
SETUP program (often by pressing DEL during the power up sequence;
sometimes by pressing F10). You must then find and change the
appropriate configuration parameter to permit instant power
on.</p><p>Normally, this is located under the <span class="bold"><b>BOOT</b></span> menu item, and will be called something
such as <span class="bold"><b>Restore on AC/Power Loss</b></span> or
<span class="bold"><b>Full-On</b></span>. The exact words will vary
according to the ROM BIOS provider. Generally you will have three
options: <span class="bold"><b>Last State</b></span>, <span class="bold"><b>Power On</b></span>, and <span class="bold"><b>Power
Off</b></span>. Although <span class="bold"><b>Last State</b></span>
should normally work, we recommend setting your computers to <span class="bold"><b>Power On</b></span>. This means that whenever the power is
applied they are on. The only way to shut them off is to pull the plug
or to have a special program that powers them off
(<tt class="filename">/sbin/poweroff</tt> on Linux systems).</p><p>If after making all the changes suggested above, you cannot get
your computer to automatically reboot, you might examine your halt
script (<tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</tt> in the case of
Red Hat Linux) and see if the final line that performs the halt or
reboot contains the <tt class="option">-p</tt> option for powering down the
computer. It should not with the logic used by
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>, but if it does, the
<tt class="option">-p</tt> option could cause your computer to power off
while the UPS is still suppling power (i.e. before the UPS kills the
power).  Depending on the setting of your BIOS, it may prevent your
computer from restarting when the power returns. As already mentioned,
this should not apply, but in case of problems it is worth a
try.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2876494"></a>Making sure <i class="application">apcupsd</i> Is Running</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>The simplest way to invoke <i class="application"> apcupsd</i>

power. In effect, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> does not
know or care where the power really comes from.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2878168"></a>A Sample NIS Slave Configuration Using the Net Driver</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>As opposed to the master/slave mode demonstrated above, you can
turn any computer into an NIS slave by configuring with the NIS network
driver turned on <tt class="option">--enable-net</tt>. The difference is
that the NIS server has no explicit knowledge of the slaves. The NIS server
makes its information available via the net (NIS), and the NIS slaves read
it. When the NIS server is going to shutdown, it makes the information
available to any NIS slave that polls it, but the NIS server does not
explicitly call each NIS slave as is the case in the Master/Slave networking
described several sections above.
</p><p>
Running in this
configuration, you can use any computer with
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> running the Network Information
Server (NIS) as the server. The NIS slave simply uses the NIS information
to decide when to shutdown. This is a much simpler mode than the older
master/slave code mentioned above.</p><p>
The main apcupsd (NIS server) is connected to the UPS
and has NIS turned on, but the configuration is a simple standalone
as in the section <span class="bold"><b>A Simple Configuration for a SmartUPS</b></span>. It doesn't
matter how the UPS is connected to the computer (serial, USB, ...). 
</p><p>
For the NIS slave computer, you will have a configuration that looks something
like what follows. What is important is that you get the information
from an <span class="bold"><b>ether</b></span> cable over the network and you must specify the
address of a &quot;NIS server&quot; that is running NIS (not the Master/Slave
networking described above). The NIS slave apcupsd will then poll the NIS server
at the NETTIME interval you specify to obtain the status.</p><pre class="programlisting">
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE ether
UPSTYPE net
LOCKFILE /var/lock
DEVICE server-network-address:3551
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
NETTIME 10
</pre><p>where on the <span class="bold"><b>DEVICE</b></span> directive
you replace the <tt class="option">server-network-address</tt> with the fully
qualified domain name or IP address of a machine running
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> with NIS enabled (and normally, but
not required, connected to a UPS). The :3551 that follows the NIS server
address is the port to use. The default is 3551, but older versions of
apcupsd used port 7000.</p><p>Please do not confuse this with a master/slave network
configuration that is described above. This is a master/slave
setup, but much simpler (the NIS server does not know about the
slaves), and any NIS server, even a slave, can act as a server to a
slave that listens to it.</p><p>The <span class="bold"><b>NETTIME</b></span> directive defines the time interval       
that the slave uses to poll the NIS server. If you set this too large,
your slave may not see the change in state of the NIS server before
the server has shutdown. Normally, you have at least 30 seconds
of grace time between the time the NIS server decides to shutdown and
the time it no longer responds. Your slave must poll during this
interval.</p><p>This mode works principally by reading the STATFLAG record that
is sent by the NIS (present in the output of apcaccess). The low 16
bits are the standard APC status flag, and the upper 16 bits
represent the internal state of apcupsd, so the slave can see when
the power fails and know when to shutdown.</p><p>As with the Master/Slave configuration, any slave run using
the Net driver will shutdown when its own timers expire or when
the NIS server shuts down, whichever occurs first. This means that

running and has started the two (default) child processes.
If you are running with the pthreaded version, now the default, and
2.4.x kernels, you will still see the three processes (see

<i class="application">apcupsd</i> running, don't worry about it
as this is normal on most non-Linux systems, and on Linux 2.6.x
kernels. </p><p>If you do not find that <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is

<i class="application">apcupsd</i> is handling the connection to the
UPS correctly. This test assumes you have a UPS that speaks apcsmart
protocol, over either USB or a serial port.  If you have an old-style
voltage-signaling UPS, please skip to the next section (Simulated
Power Fail Test).</p><p>When <i class="application">apcupsd</i> detects a problem, it
generates an EVENT, which consists of sending a message to the system
log then invoking the <span class="bold"><b>apccontrol</b></span>
script (normally in <tt class="filename">/etc/acpupsd/apccontrol</tt>) to
handle the event.</p><p>In order to create an event, remove the serial port plug from
the back of your computer or from the back of the UPS. Within 6
seconds, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> should detect the lack of
serial port communications and broadcast a <b class="command">wall</b>
message indicating that the serial port communications was
lost:</p><p>Warning communications lost with UPS lost.</p><p>At the same time, it sends the same message to the system log
and to the temporary EVENTS file
(<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</tt>).</p><p>Plug the serial port plug back into your computer, and within
about 12 seconds, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> should
reestablish communications and broadcast and log the following
message:</p><p>Communications with UPS restored.</p><p>If these messages are logged but not broadcast, either you have
your <i class="application">mesg</i> permission set to
<span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> (see <span class="bold"><b>man
wall</b></span>) or there is a problem with
<i class="application">apccontrol</i>. If you are running a window
manager such as GNOME and don't have a console window open, you may
not receive the <b class="command">wall</b> messages. However, you should
find them in your system log file (normally
<tt class="filename">/var/log/messages</tt> and in the temporary EVENTS
file, <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</tt>. For example,
to observe these events in the temporary EVENTS file, you might do
a</p><pre class="programlisting">
tail -f /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events
</pre><p>before running the test.</p><p>If you do not observe these messages, you should correct this
problem before proceeding with additional tests.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2879666"></a>Simulated Power Fail Test</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>At this point, you should verify that in the event of a power
fail <i class="application">apcupsd</i> properly calls
<i class="application">apccontrol</i>. This test is appropriate for
all models of UPSes (smart or dumb).</p><p>To avoid the possibility that <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
might shut down your system, locate where
<i class="application">apccontrol</i> resides on your system
(normally, <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt>. Move this
script to another location e.g. <tt class="filename">apccontrol.save</tt>
and replace it with the script found in
<tt class="filename">examples/safe.apccontrol</tt>. When that is done,
ensure that your UPS battery is fully charged and that you have at
least 5 minutes of remaining runtime on the batteries. This can be
done by examining the values of the <span class="bold"><b>BATTCHG</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>TIMELEFT</b></span> variables in the printout of
<b class="command">apcaccess status</b>.</p><p>Athough this should not be necessary, as an extra precaution,
you can shutdown your machine, remove the plug from the UPS you are
testing, and plug your machine into another UPS or directly into the
wall. Doing so, will ensure that the UPS doesn't cut the power to your
machine at a bad time. Remember at the end of the testing to plug your
machine back into the UPS.</p><p>You can also minimize the risk from an unexpected shutdown by
using a journaling filesystem such as Linux's EXT3.  All modern disk
drives park themselves safely when they power down, rather than ploughing
up oxide on your disk's recording surface.  Thus, unexpected power less 
has to hit very narrow timing windows in order to trash an EXT3 
transaction.</p><p>To begin the test, pull the power plug from the UPS. The first
time that you do this, psychologically it won't be easy, but after you
have pulled the plug a few times, you may even come to enjoy it. If
all goes well, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> should detect the
power failure and print several warning messages. The first should
appear after 5 to 6 seconds and read:</p><pre class="programlisting">
Warning power loss detected.
</pre><p>Then generally 6 seconds later,
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> is sure that it isn't a transient
effect, so it sends:</p><pre class="programlisting">
Power failure. Running on UPS batteries.
</pre><p>After a few more seconds (total around 15 seconds), plug the
power cord back in and ensure that <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
is aware that the power has returned. It should print:</p><pre class="programlisting">
Power has returned...
</pre><p>If you do not observe the above messages, please correct the
situation before proceeding. The most likely cause of problems
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><i class="application">apcupsd</i> doesn't recognize the
    power failure because the configuration directives are not
    correct. E.g. wrong cable.</p></li><li><p>The file <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> doesn't 
    exist or is not marked as executable.</p></li></ul></div><p>At this point, we recommend that you do a simulated power down
of your system. If you are adventuresome or have been through this
before, skip to the next section in this manual and do the real power
fail shutdown. If you continue with the simulated power down and if
all goes well, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> will go through all
the motions without actually shutting down the system. Continue using
the safe <i class="application">apccontrol</i> that you
installed. Edit the configuration file <tt class="filename">apcupsd</tt>
and change the value of <span class="bold"><b>TIMEOUT</b></span> from
0 to something like 30. Doing so will cause
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to attempt to shutdown the system
30 seconds after it detects a power failure. Once this change has been
made, you must stop and restart <i class="application">apcupsd</i> for
the new configuration value to take effect.</p><p>Once again, pull the power plug, and if all goes as expected,
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> should attempt to shutdown the
system about 30 seconds after it detects the power failure. All the
messages should be displayed by <b class="command">wall</b> or by the
<b class="command">tail -f</b> command. The precise message is determined
by what is printed in <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> for
the <span class="bold"><b>doshutdown</b></span> event.  Though it
varies from system to system, it will generally be something
like:</p><pre class="programlisting">
Beginning Shutdown Sequence
</pre><p>When <i class="application">apcupsd</i> this message prints,
reconnect the power.  <i class="application">apcupsd</i> should detect
that the power has been restored and attempt to cancel the
shutdown.</p><p><span class="bold"><b>IMPORTANT</b></span> after this test,
please replace the changed <i class="application">apccontrol</i> and
<tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> with the original files.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2880355"></a>System Shutdown Test</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>This is an intermediate test that you can do, for all UPS models
before doing the Full Power Down Test. First modify the
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> file so that in the
<span class="bold"><b>killpower)</b></span> case, the line that
re-executes <i class="application">apcupsd</i> with the
<tt class="option">--killpower</tt> option is commented out. The original
line probably looks something like:</p><pre class="programlisting">
${APCUPSD} --killpower
</pre><p>when it is commented out, it looks like:</p><pre class="programlisting">
#${APCUPSD}--killpower
</pre><p>Now when you pull the power plug, and either the timer expires
or the batteries are exhausted (see the next section for more
details), the system should be fully shutdown.</p><p>After performing this test, please be sure to restore
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> to its previous
state.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2880435"></a>Full Power Down Test</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>To complete the testing, you should do a power fail shutdown of
your system. This test is applicable to all UPS models. Please do a
backup of your system or take other precautions before attempting this
to avoid the possibility of lost data due to a problem (I have been
through this at least 10 times and never once had problems, but we all
know that someday something will go wrong).</p><p>Before proceeding, please ensure that your halt script or the
equivalent has been properly updated by the install process to contain
the logic to call <b class="command">apcupsd --killpower</b> when it
detects a power failure situation (the presence of a
<tt class="filename">/etc/powerfail</tt> file). See the <a href="manual.html#build_install" title="Chapter&#xA0;2.&#xA0;Building and Installing apcupsd">Chapter&nspb;&nspb;2, <i>Building and Installing apcupsd</i></a> of this manual, or the README files for
additional details about the halt modifications necessary.</p><p>When you are ready to do the test, either simply pull the plug
and wait for the batteries to become exhausted, or set the <span class="bold"><b>TIMEOUT</b></span> configuration directive to something
like 60 so that the system will shutdown before the batteries are
exhausted. We recommend doing the full shutdown without using
<span class="bold"><b>TIMEOUT</b></span> to correctly simulate a real
power failure, but the choice is yours (I did it once here, but now
use TIMEOUT 30).</p><p>If all goes well, your system should be shutdown before the
batteries are completely exhausted and the UPS should be powered off
by <i class="application">apcupsd</i>. Please be aware that if you do
the full power down, you must ensure that your UPS is totally powered
off.  Otherwise, it may have been given the command to power off, but
due to a long grace period it is still waiting. If you were to reboot
your computer during the grace period, the UPS could then suddenly
turn off the power (this happened to me). To avoid this problem,
always wait for your UPS to power itself off, or power if off manually
before restarting your computer. On my system, the UPS is configured
as at the factory to have a 180 second grace period before shutting
off the power. During this type of testing, 180 seconds <span class="bold"><b>seems</b></span> like an eternity, so please take care to
either wait or manually power off your UPS. To determine what grace
period is programmed into your UPS EEPROM, run <b class="command">apcaccess
eprom</b> and look at the &quot;Shutdown grace
delay&quot;.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2880552"></a>Shutdown Sequence</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>If you experienced so problems with the above testing

1) Query the UPS for all known values
2) Perform a Battery Runtime Calibration
3) Abort Battery Calibration
4) Monitor Battery Calibration progress
5) Program EEPROM
6) Enter TTY mode communicating with UPS
7) Quit

Select function number: 1

</pre><p>Item 1 will probe the UPS for all values known to
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> and present them in rather raw
format. This output can be useful for providing technical support if
you are having problems with your UPS.</p><p>Item 2 will perform a Battery Runtime Calibration. This test
will only be performed if your battery is 100% charged. Running the
test will cause the batteries to be discharged to approximately 30% of
capacity. The exact number depends on the UPS model. In any case,
<i class="application">apctest</i> will abort the test if it detects
that the battery charge is 20% or less.</p><p>The advantage of doing this test is that the UPS will be able to
recalibrate the remaining runtime counter that it maintains in its
firmware. As your batteries age, they tend to hold less of a
charge, so the runtime calibration may not be accurate after
several years.</p><p>We recommend that perform a Battery Calibration about once a
year. You should not perform this calibration too often since
discharging the batteries tends to shorten their lifespan.</p><p>Item 3 can be used to abort a Battery Calibration in progress,
if you some how became disconnected.</p><p>Item 4 can be used to restart the monitoring of a Battery
Calibration if you should some how become disconnected during the
test.</p><p>Item 5 is used to program the EEPROM. Please see the <a href="manual.html#eprom" title="Configuration Directives Used to Set the &#10;UPS EPROM">the section called “Configuration Directives Used to Set the 
UPS EPROM”</a> chapter of this manual for
the details.</p><p>Item 6 will initiate a direct communication between your
terminal and the UPS at which point, you can enter raw UPS
commands. Please be aware that you should be careful what commands you

Unfortunately, some cheaper USB models do not seem to report
BCHARGE in the apcaccess output listing, which means with a
standard conf file, your system will be immediately shutdown.
To correct this, set the BATTERYLEVEL directive in your apcupsd.conf
file to -1.
</p><p>
Some of these cheaper USB UPSes also do not report the Voltage. This
is annoying but does not cause the unit to malfunction.

will probably want to query the state of its health occasionally.
The tools <i class="application">apcupsd</i> gives you to do this 
include one command-line utility (<i class="application">apcaccess</i>) 
and a GUI you can use through a Web browser.  You can also use
<i class="application">apctest</i> to tune some parameters of the UPS 
itself.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2881609"></a>apcaccess</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p><i class="application">apcaccess</i> is a program (normally found
in <tt class="filename">/sbin/apcaccess</tt>) that permits you to print out
the complete status of your UPS. Although there are a number of
command line arguments (<span class="bold"><b>eprom, reconfig,
status, slave, shutdown</b></span>), all except <span class="bold"><b>eprom</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>status</b></span> are under development and hence do not
work reliably.</p><p>If you have built <i class="application">apcupsd</i> with
pthreads enabled (default), <i class="application">apcaccess</i> will use the
Network Information Server to obtain the necessary information for the
<span class="bold"><b>status</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>eeprom</b></span> commands. This is because in the
pthreaded version, there is no IPC shared memory. In this case
(pthreads enabled), you can specify a second optional argument to
<i class="application">apcaccess</i> in the form of host:port, where
the :port is optional. The default is <span class="bold"><b>localhost:3551</b></span>. Please note that in versions
prior to 3.10.6, the default NIS port was 7000, so if you are mixing
versions, you will need to take a lot of care to ensure that all
components are using the same port.</p><p>
To enable the
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> Network Information Server, which
is normally the default, you set:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
NETSERVER on
NISPORT 3551
</pre><p>
in your <span class="bold"><b>apcupsd.conf</b></span> file.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2881897"></a>apcaccess status</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
As mentioned above, the full form of the command is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
apcaccess status localhost:3551 
</pre><p>
where only <i class="application">apcaccess status</i> should normally
be needed. localhost may be replaced by any machine name, fully qualified 
domain name, or IP address, which means that <i class="application">apcaccess</i>
can access any UPS on the network running the Network Information Server.
</p><p>The <span class="bold"><b>status</b></span> command line option
of <i class="application">apcaccess</i> will produce a full printout
of all the <span class="bold"><b>STATUS</b></span> variables used by
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>. This can be very helpful for
checking the condition of your UPS and to know whether or not
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> is properly connected to it. For a
complete description of the variables and their meanings, please read
the <a href="manual.html#statusformat" title="Chapter&#xA0;27.&#xA0;apcupsd Status Logging">Status Format</a> section of the
Technical Reference.</p><p>Please note that if you invoke
<i class="application">apcaccess</i> within the first 30 seconds of
launching <i class="application">apcupsd</i>, you will likely get an
error message such as:</p><pre class="programlisting">
APCACCESS FATAL ERROR in apcipc.c at line 325
attach_shmarea: shared memory version mismatch
</pre><p>This is because <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is still in
the process of initializing the shared memory segment used to
communicate between the two processes. There is also a small window of
time after which the memory segment is properly initialized but before
the UPS has been completely polled. If you invoke
<i class="application">apcaccess</i> during this period, you will get
the STATUS output, but with many of the values zero. The solution is
to wait at least 30 seconds after starting
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> before launching
<i class="application">apcaccess</i>.</p><p>To invoke apcaccess, enter:</p><pre class="programlisting">

For the various smaller, cheaper APC USB UPSes, such as the CS, ES, ..., you 
will get much of the information that is presented above, but not all of
it. For example, you will not get MAXLINEV, MINLINEV, LINEFREQ, ...
and in particular, the LOADPCT will be zero when you are running on mains.
LOADPCT will display when the UPS is on batteries.  You must remember that the     
non-SmartUPSes are much simpler (and less expensive) and therefore produce

When a major event is generated within <i class="application">apcupsd</i>,
control is passed to the script <tt class="filename">apccontrol</tt> normally
found in <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt>. The event name,
and a number of other important parameters are passed to the script.
</p><p>
The major function of the <tt class="filename">apccontrol</tt> script is
to performa a shutdown of the system (as well as the killpower
operation). In addition, another major task for this script is to
notify you by email when certain events such as powerfail occur.
</p><p>
Since <tt class="filename">apccontrol</tt> is a script, you can 
customize it to your own needs using any text editor. To do 
so, you must have a minimal knowledge of Unix shell programming.
In addition, another feature is that you can write your own 
scripts that will be automatically called by <tt class="filename">apccontrol</tt>
before any of its own code is executed.
Details of the events and how to program them are contained in
the Advanced topics section entitled <a href="manual.html#events" title="Chapter&#xA0;11.&#xA0;Customizing Event Handling">

with <tt class="option">--enable-cgi</tt> and you should specify an
installation directory with <tt class="option">--with-cgi-bin=</tt> or load
them manually. To install the Cascading Style Sheet, which is used by

configured to run the Network Information Server. This is done by
setting <span class="bold"><b>NETSERVER on</b></span> in
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</tt>.  This switch is on by
default.  If you are unsure of its state, see the section at the end
of this chapter concerning the Client test program.</p><p>Next you must edit the <tt class="filename">hosts</tt> file
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/hosts.conf</tt> and at the end, add the
name of the hosts you want to monitor and a label string for them. Kern
Sibbald uses <tt class="filename">multimon.conf</tt> unmodified from what
is on the source distribution. However, he has modified the hosts.conf
file to contain the following three lines:</p><pre class="programlisting">
MONITOR matou &quot;Server&quot;
MONITOR polymatou &quot;Backup server&quot;
MONITOR deuter  &quot;Disk server&quot;
</pre><p>matou, polymatou, and deuter are the network names of the three
machines currently running <i class="application">apcupsd</i>. Please
note that the network names may either be IP addresses or fully
qualified domain names.  The network name (or IP address) may
optionally be followed by <span class="bold"><b>:&lt;port&gt;</b></span>, where the port is the NIS port
address you wish to use. This is useful if you are running multiple
copies of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> on the same system or if
you are running in a mixed vendor environment where the NIS port
assignments differ. An example could be the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
MONITOR matou &quot;Server&quot;
MONITOR polymatou &quot;Backup server&quot;
MONITOR deuter  &quot;Disk server&quot;
MONITOR polymatou:7001 &quot;APC USB UPS&quot;
</pre><p>where the USB copy of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> has
been configured to use port 7001 (with
<tt class="option">--with-nis-port=7001</tt> on the
<b class="command">./configure</b> or by modifying
<tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt>). Note, the default NIS port is 3551
on most platforms.</p><p>To test multimon.cgi, you can execute it as non-root directly
from the source cgi build directory. To do so, enter at a shell
prompt:</p><pre class="programlisting">
./multimon.cgi
</pre><p>If everything is set up correctly, it will print a bunch of HTML

test it using a simple program before attempting to access the server
via your Web server. The test program is called
<tt class="filename">client.c</tt> and can be found in the
<tt class="filename">examples</tt> subdirectory of the source
distribution. To build the program, when in the examples directory,
use something like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
cc client.c ../lib/libapc.a -o client
</pre><p>Then execute it:</p><pre class="programlisting">
./client &lt;host&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;] [&lt;command&gt;]
</pre><p>Where <span class="bold"><b>host</b></span> is the name of the
host or the IP address of the host running the Network Information
Server. The default is the local host. You may optionally specify a
port address separated from the host name with a colon. You may also
optionally specify a single command to be executed. If you specify a
command, that command will be executed and the client program will
exit. This is a very simple and useful way of pulling the <span class="bold"><b>status</b></span> or <span class="bold"><b>events</b></span> data into another program such as
Perl.</p><p>If no error messages are printed, it has most likely established
contact with your server. Anything that you type as standard input
will be passed to the server, and anything the server sends back will
be printed to standard output. There are currently two commands
recognized by the server: <span class="bold"><b>events</b></span> and
<span class="bold"><b>status</b></span>.  Hence the following
commands:</p><pre class="programlisting">
./client
status
events
xyz
^D
</pre><p>should produce the status listing (the same as produced by
<b class="command">apcaccess status</b>), followed by the list of the last
10 events (in response to the <span class="bold"><b>events</b></span>
command), and finally <span class="bold"><b>Invalid command</b></span>
in response to the <span class="bold"><b>xyz</b></span> input, which
is not a valid command. The control-D terminates the <span class="bold"><b>client</b></span> program.</p><p>
The purpose of this program is to show you how to write your own
program that can determine the status of <i class="application">apcupsd</i>

      consider this information privileged, as is the case for me,
      there is little risk. In addition, if you have a firewall

your EEPROM values unless absolutely necessary. There have been
several reported cases of problems setting the Low Transfer

to program the EEPROM. Instead we have implemented interactive EEPROM
modification code in the <i class="application">apctest</i>
program. EEPROM programming must be done with
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> stopped so that
<i class="application">apctest</i> can access the UPS. In addition,
EEPROM programming is currently implemented only for UPSes using the
Smart protocol running in serial mode. Perhaps at a later time when
the appropriate kernel modifications are standard, we will extend
EEPROM programming to USB models.</p><p>Before changing your EEPROM, you should make a printed copy of
the current state of your UPS before any EEPROM changes so that you
can check the changes that you have made. Do so by printing a copy
of the output from <b class="command">apcaccess status</b> and also print a copy of
the output from <b class="command">apcaccess eprom</b>.</p><p>Once this is done, choose which values of the EEPROM you want to
change. Typical output from <i class="application">apcaccess</i>
should look like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">

problems. Below, you will find some suggestions for replacing
batteries. One <span class="emphasis"><em>important</em></span> note of caution: at
least one user purchased one of the non-APC batteries noted below and
found out that they would not fit into his unit. This required cutting
and soldering and other very undesirable things, so be extremely
careful in measuring the batteries including every millimeter of the
terminal connections which can cause problems.</p><p>Although you can do a hot swap of your batteries while the
computer is running, it may not be very satisfactory because the unit
will not know that the batteries have been swapped and apcupsd will
continue to show Low Battery.  To correct this situation, you must do a
discharge and recharge of the battery followed by a battery
recalibration using <i class="application">apctest</i>.  At that point
the battery should be calibrated better.  As noted below, Carl has found
that it takes several discharge/charges before the runtime calibration
is accurate.  Take care not to discharge your battery too much as it
tends to shorten the battery life.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2886415"></a>What Various People Have to Say about Batteries</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Here is what John Walker has to say about APC UPS batteries:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I thought I'd pass on some information I've obtained which
you'll probably eventually need. Besides, by writing it down I'll be
able to find it the next time. I started installing mine in
1995-1996. Lead-acid batteries have a finite life even if not
subjected to deep discharge cycles. For the batteries used by APC,
this is typically four to six years. As part of the self-test cycle,
the UPS measures the voltage of the battery at full charge (which
falls as the battery ages), and if it's below about 90% of the value
for a new battery, it sets off the &quot;Replace battery&quot; alarm,
which it repeats every day. [on apcupsd versions prior to 3.8.0, this
message is sent once, on version 3.8.0, it is sent every 9 hours -
KES]. You will occasionally get a false alarm. It's a good idea if you
get an alarm to repeat the self-test the next day and see if the alarm
goes away. If the alarm is persistent, you need to replace the
batteries, which can be done without powering down the UPS or load-you
just open up the battery door, take out the old batteries, and hook up
the new ones.</p><p>APC makes &quot;Replacement Battery Units&quot; for each of the
SmartUPS models, but they sell them directly only in the U.S.</p><p>It's best to wait until the low battery alarm before ordering a
replacement-keeping batteries on the shelf reduces their life unless
you keep them fully charged.</p></blockquote></div><p>And Andre Hendrick says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[For replacement batteries] You need to goto you your local

</pre></blockquote></div><p>Finally, here is what Carl Erhorn has to say about
batteries:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Hi, Folks.</p><p>Well, Kern was absolutely right. The problem with my UPS was
batteries. It was unexpected though, because there was no
indication of a bad battery right up until the UPS failed
entirely.</p><p>For those who might encounter the same thing, and don't know
what's happening (I didn't either), here's what happened.</p><p>A week or so ago, I turned on one of my SmartUPS 700-NET models.
The load is a small dual P-III unix server (Solaris 8, X86) and a
4MM tape drive. During the normal selftest that runs when you first
turn on any APC UPS, the UPS 'freaked out'. The alarm stuttered at
about 4 or 5 beeps per second, and all the panel lights flashed
spasmodically, as if something was loose inside the UPS.</p><p>I turned off the UPS and it's load, then turned the UPS on
again. This time, everything seemed fine. I booted the system that
was attached, and there were no problems. The status monitor showed
9 minutes runtime (which indicates fairly low capacity), but the
batteries showed fully charged. I began to suspect a bad inverter
in the UPS.</p><p>However, Kern told me that he suspected the batteries. So I took
the UPS offline, put an old SU-600 in it's place (just barely big
enough to handle the startup peaks - I get an 'overload' lamp lit
for about 2 seconds during boot), and checked out the batteries.
They did indicate that they were near the end of life, so I ordered
a replacement set. Those came in on Friday, and after the initial
charge, a complete charge/discharge cycle to recalibrate the UPS,
and some testing, I put it back in service.</p><p>Surprise! (Or maybe not?) Kern was right - there is nothing
wrong with the inverter or the charging circuit, and the new cells
fixed everything.</p><p>What confused me is that there was no 'replace battery'
indication from the UPS, even when it failed, plus a fair amount of
runtime indicated with a full charge. So if you see such behavior
on one of your UPS models, it makes sense to replace the batteries,
even if there is no indication that the batteries have failed
yet.</p><p>One of the things I learned during this process is that the UPS
internal calibration will lose accuracy over the life of the
battery. I always do a recalibrate when I install new cells, but
rarely do it after that, as it's time-consuming, and you really
can't use the system attached to the UPS while doing it. Since my
systems are almost constantly in use, it's a pain to schedule a
recal, and I tend to put it off. This time it bit me. I'd suggest
that folks do a recal at least once every six months. It will make
your runtime estimates much more accurate, and also allows you to
keep track of the state of your batteries.</p><p>For those who don't know how to do this, here's what you do.
This proceedure should not be confused with the 'Recalibrate'
feature in the APC PowerchutePlus software. They do not do the same
thing.</p><p>&gt;From APC's web site:</p><p>Perform a Runtime Calibration. This is a manual procedure and
should not be confused with the runtime calibration performed
through PowerChute plus. The batteries inside of the Smart-UPS are
controlled by a microprocessor within the UPS. Sometimes it is
necessary to reset this microprocessor, especially after the
installation of new batteries. Stop the PowerChute plus software
from running and disconnect the serial cable. There must be at
least a 30% load attached to the UPS during this procedure, but the
process will cause the UPS to shut off and cut power to its
outlets. Therefore, attach a non-critical load to the UPS and then
force the UPS on battery by disconnecting it from utility power.
Allow the unit to run on battery until it turns off completely.
Make sure a 30% load is present! Plug the UPS back into the wall
outlet and allow it to recharge (it will recharge more quickly
turned off and with no load present). Once the unit has recharged,
the &quot;runtime remaining&quot; calculation should be more accurate.
Remember that if the unit is an older model, then the runtime will
not improve significantly.</p><p>Background:</p><p>An APC Smart-UPS has a microprocessor which calculates runtime
primarily based on the load attached to the UPS and on its battery
capacity. On the right side of the front display panel there is a
vertical graph of five LEDs. Each LED is an indication of battery
charge in increments of twenty percent: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100%
(bottom to top). For example, if the battery charge is 99%, then
only four of the five LEDs are illuminated.</p><p>To ensure that an operating system receives a graceful shutdown
when using PowerChute plus or a SmartSlot accessory, an alert is
generated by the Smart-UPS indicating that the UPS has reached a
low battery condition. The alert is audible (rapid beeping), visual
(flashing battery LED or LEDs), and readable through the graphical
interface of PowerChute plus software (or a native UPS shutdown
program within a particular operating system.) In order to
calculate this &quot;low battery condition,&quot; all Smart-UPS products have
a preconfigured low battery signal warning time of two minutes
(this is the factory default setting). There are a total of four
user-changeable settings: 2, 5, 7, or 10 minutes. If the low
battery signal warning time is set for 2 minutes, then the alerts
will activate simultaneously two minutes prior to shutdown.
Similarly, if the total runtime for a particular UPS is 30 minutes
with a low battery signal warning time set at 10 minutes, then the
UPS will run on battery for 20 minutes before the low battery alert
begins.</p><p>Total runtime is primarily based on two factors, battery
capacity and UPS load. UPS load and runtime on battery are
inversely proportional: as load increases, battery runtime
decreases and vice versa. When utility power is lost, the UPS
begins discharging the battery in order to support the attached
load. Once power returns, the Smart-UPS will automatically begin to
recharge its battery.</p><p>My comments on this proceedure:</p><p>I believe this proceedure works for all APC models that calulate
runtime, not just the SmartUPS. It's important that you load the
UPS to 30% of the UPS capacity, as reported by apcupsd or another
UPS monitor program. I've found that normal house lamps of
different wattages allow me to adjust the load to almost exactly
what I want, which is between 30% and 35% of the UPS capacity. This
is critical te getting an accurate reading (according to the APC
web documents). Always bring the UPS to 100% charge first, as
indicated by the front panel lamps, or your UPS monitoring
software.</p><p>Set the UPS shutdown time to 2 minutes, all other settings to
nominal, and disconnect the serial port cable from the UPS before
running the recalibration. If you leave a monitoring program
running through the serial port, it will turn the UPS off early,
and you don't want to do that during a recalibration run. When the
run is complete, and the UPS turns off, you can reattach the serial
cable, and the normal loads, and recharge the batteries normally.
If you think you might have a power outage during the recharge
time, allow the UPS to recharge to 20% or so (indicated by the
panel lamps) before trying to use the computer system. This will
allow the UPS to handle short dropouts while it recharges. Of
course, if you can leave the computer off during the recharge time,
the UPS will recharge much faster.</p><p>As an aside, when the batteries failed, my total runtime at 100%
charge and an idle state was 9 minutes, which is pretty bad. I
replaced the batteries with extended capacity cells, which add
about 15% to the stock capacity. Now, after two complete charge/
discharge cycles, 100% charge shows the available runtime to be 42
minutes on the system when it's idle, and 33 minutes when the
system is very busy. The differences are due to the load of the
computer, when the disks are busy, and the cpus are not in a halted
state (my system halts the cpus when they are idle, to save power
and lower heat, as do other OS like Linux), when compared to an
idle state. Apcupsd indicates the load is about 27% when idle, and
as much as 37% when heavily loaded.</p><p>I've found that two charge/discharge cycles result in a more
accurate recalibration when installing new cells. It appears that
some batteries need to be put through a couple of complete cycles
before they reach their full capacity. I've also noticed that the
full-charge voltage is different for each battery until they have
been through two cycles. On the initial charge of my new batteries,
the 100% charge voltage on the two cells was almost .5 VDC apart.
After two complete cycles, the batteries measure within .01 VDC of
each other!</p><p>I hope this information helps anyone who might encounter the
problem I saw, and also shows folks how to recal their batteries.
If you haven't done a complete recalibration in a year or two, I'd
recommend it, so that you have warning of a low battery instead of
what happened to me.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>--Carl</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2887246"></a>Where Carl Suggests You Get Batteries</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Hi, Folks.</p><p>I'm just replacing the batteries in one of my SmartUPS models,
and it occurs to me that some of you may not know about the place I
get them from. I have no relationship with this company, other than
as a customer, but I feel they know what they are doing, their
prices are fair, and they have some interesting batteries available
that you can't obtain from APC.</p><p>These are the reasons I use them, and I thought this information
might be useful to the US list members. They will ship outside of
the US. If you have questions, you can contact them through the
email address listed on their web pages. They have always responded
pretty quickly to my questions.</p><p>The company is called Battery Wholesale Distributors, and they
are located in Georgetown, Texas. If you have questions, you can
reach them by phone at (800) 365-8444, 9:00AM to 5:00PM (their
local time), Monday through Friday. I've gotten email from them on
the weekends, although the office is not open then.</p><p>I won't post prices, as you can get current pricing from their
web site. They have an entire section dedicated to APC replacement
batteries, and it's easy to find what you need. You can order over
the web, or by phone. They accept all the usual credit cards.</p><p>The web site (as you might guess) is: <a href="http://www.batterywholesale.com" target="_top">www.batterywholesale.com</a></p><p>The thing I really like is that they have found manufacturers
who make batteries in the standard case sizes, but have additional
capacity over the original batteries shipped with the APC UPS
models. Often, the difference is as much as 15% or so, and this can
result in additional runtime. It's a nice upgrade for a minor
increase in price.</p><p>They are also 'green-aware', in that they encourage you to
recycle your old batteries, and will accept the old batteries back
from you if you cannot find a local place that recycles them. You
pay the shipping, but I think other than that, there is no charge.
I've never done this, as I have a battery retailer just down the
street who will accept my old batteries.</p><p>Anyway, if you didn't know about these folks, put the info aside
where you can find it when you need replacement batteries. I won't
make any guarantees, but I've been very pleased with their
products, service, and pricing. I hope you find them as helpful to
you as I do. I've been dealing with them since about 1994, and have
never been disappointed. The owner of the place also is very good
on technical issues, so if you have questions on their products, he
can get as technical as you need to go.</p><pre class="programlisting">

a cheap way to accomplish this — in fact, they tended to be wired so
that if you tried a straight-through cable, opening a serial link to
the UPS would be interpreted as a shutdown command!</p><p>(Hardware companies often think like this — they lock up

your UPS device, it will make some decisions that usually result in
one or more calls to the script located in
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt>. The <span class="bold"><b>apccontrol</b></span> file is a shell script that acts on
the first argument that <i class="application">apcupsd</i> passes to
it. These actions are set up by default to sane behavior for all
psituations <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is likely to
detect from the UPS. However, you can change the
<i class="application">apccontrol</i> behavior for every single
action.</p><p>To customize, so create a file with the same name as the action,
which is passed as a command line argument. Put your script in the
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd</tt> directory.</p><p>These events are sent to the system log, optionally sent to the
temporary events file
(<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</tt>), and they also
generate a call to <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> which
in turn will call any scripts you have placed in the

only by <i class="application">apcupsd</i>. Consequently, you should
not invoke it directly.  However, it is important to understand how it
functions, and in some cases, you may want to change the messages that
it prints using <b class="command">wall</b>. We recommend that you do so
by writing your own script to be invoked by
<b class="command">apccontrol</b> rather than by modifying
<i class="application">apccontrol</i> directly. This makes it easier
for you to upgrade to the next version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i></p><p>In other case, you may want to write your own shell scripts that
will be invoked by <i class="application">apccontrol</i>. For example,
when a power fail occurs, you may want to send an email message to

apcupsds using the new 3.10.x code and the <span class="bold"><b>net</b></span> driver. This mode of NIS server/slave
networking is considerably different from the old method described at
the beginning of this chapter. In the old code, there is a lot of
configuration on both the master and slave side, and the master polls
or sends info to the slave. Using the <span class="bold"><b>net</b></span> driver is much simpler. However, you should
carefully check that the NIS slave does a proper shutdown. In the
master/slave code, the master ensures the best it can that the slave
is shutdown or notified before it shuts down itself. On the other
hand, using the net driver, the NIS server knows nothing about the NIS slaves
that may be listening and thus takes no special precautions to ensure
that the NIS slaves receive the shutdown signal. Since the NIS slave reads the
master's data once per second there should be no shutdown problems,
and our experience confirms this.  This question can only  be answered
by carefully testing the shutdown.</p><p>In this NIS server/slave mode, the NIS server is a standard stand alone
configuration except that it must have <span class="bold"><b>NETSERVER
on</b></span> in the configuration file and have an <span class="bold"><b>NISPORT nnn</b></span> defined. Thus any
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> running in this mode then becomes
the NIS server.</p><p>The NIS slave then uses the net driver to connect to the server's
NIS output. In this mode, the NIS slave decides how often to poll the
server for the NIS information. The NIS slave's conf file has
<span class="bold"><b>UPSTYPE net</b></span>, which will invoke the
&quot;network&quot; driver. By setting this machine's <span class="bold"><b>DEVICE</b></span> to be <span class="bold"><b>server-ip:server-NIS-port</b></span> it will automatically
connect to the NIS server and use the server's signals to shutdown the
computer.  In the example net slave configuration file below, the
slave uses the NIS information provided by the computer <span class="bold"><b>tibs</b></span> on port <span class="bold"><b>3551</b></span>.</p><pre class="programlisting">

more than one computer), the master/server and slave communicate via the
network. In many configurations, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is
started before the network is initialized. In this case, it is
possible that the master  will be unable to contact the slave. On
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> versions prior to 3.8.0, this could
cause <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to error off. The solution to
this problem is to either force <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to
be started after the network and the DNS (fiddle the symbolic links in
/etc/rc.d), or put the names of the slave machines in your

<i class="application">apcupsd</i> there are a number important steps
to complete. You must either remove or modify the file
<tt class="filename">$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol</tt>, so that it will not
shutdown Computer A when the battery of UPS 2 is low. One suggestion
is to copy <tt class="filename">examples/safe.apccontrol</tt> into
<tt class="filename">$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol</tt>. Alternatively, you
could edit the <tt class="filename">$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apccontrol</tt> and
delete all statements that attempt to shutdown the machine. Another
important step is to find a way to shutdown Computer B when UPS 2's
battery is low.  Probably the simplest way to do this is to edit
<tt class="filename">$HOME/apcupsd/bin/apcupsd.conf</tt> on Computer A so
that this second copy of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> becomes a
network master. Then install a standard slave configuration on
Computer B. Please remember that if UPS 1's batteries are exhausted
before UPS 2's batteries, Computer B may not be properly shutdown. And
at the current time, there is no simple means to make the two copies
of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> running on Computer A
communicate. Thus there are certain risks in such a
configuration. However, these configurations can be very useful for
powering electronic equipment and such.</p><p>If Computer B is vitally important, it would probably be better
to purchase a serial port card for it, or perhaps use a USB UPS. To
ensure that it is properly shutdown if Computer A goes down, you could
run a second copy of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> on Computer B
as a slave connected to the main copy of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> on Computer A. Thus Computer B
would be running two slaves, one driven by the master controlling UPS
1 and the other by the master controlling UPS 2, and Computer B could
be shutdown by the first master that signaled it to do so.</p></div></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="snmp"></a>Chapter&nspb;&nspb;14.&nspb;&nspb;Support for SNMP UPSes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><a href="manual.html#id2893487">Connecting an SNMP UPS</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2893571">Building and Installing apcupsd</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2893618">SNMP Specific Information</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2893633">Known Problems</a></dt></dl></div><p><a href="snmp" target="_top">snmp</a>

special configuration. The killpower command for SNMP UPSes can not be
issued during shutdown as typically at some time during shutdown

is needed to modify the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/apcupsd</tt> system
control script to tell <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to issue the
power down command (killpower) to the UPS immediately before apcupsd
initiates the system shutdown. For this reason it is paramount to set
your UPS grace time to a value greater than 120 seconds to allow for
clean shutdown operations before the UPS removes the power from its
plugs. To enable correct shutdown operation during powerdown do the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Connect to your Web/SNMP card using your favorite web browser,

data concerning the UPS and its operation. This information can be
obtained over the network using either
<i class="application">apcnisd</i> or
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>'s internal network information
server, which is essentially the same code as
<i class="application">apcnisd</i> but compiled into
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>. Clients on the network make a
connection to the information server and send requests for status or
events data, which the server then transmits to them.</p><p>The information served to the network by this interface should
not be confused with master/slave mode that shares a UPS between two
or more computers. That code is described in <a href="manual.html#UPS_Sharing" title="Configuration Directives for Sharing &#10;a UPS">the section called “Configuration Directives for Sharing 
a UPS”</a> of this documentation.</p><p>There are three different ways to run the information server
depending on your requirements and preferences. It can be run as 1.  a
standalone program, 2. a standalone program invoked by the inetd
daemon, or 3. as a thread (or child process) of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> (default configuration). We
recommend option 3 unless you have specific reasons to do
otherwise. Option 3 is what is configured in by default.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2894338"></a>Running the server as a child of <i class="application">apcupsd</i></h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>This is probably the simplest way to run the network information
server. To do so, you simply make sure the <span class="bold"><b>NETSERVER</b></span> directive in
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</tt> is <span class="bold"><b>on</b></span>, and then stop and restart
<i class="application">apcupsd.</i> It will automatically create the
server thread (or spawn an additional child process named
<i class="application">apcnis</i>) to handle network clients. In the
case where pthreads are enabled, a new thread will be created rather
than a child process to handle the network information requests. Note,
the above modification should not be necessary if you use the default
<tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt>, since it is already turned
on.</p><p>Although this method is simple, it affords no protection from
the outside world accessing your network server unless you
are behind a firewall. In addition, if there is a bug in the network
server code, or if a malicious user sends bad data, it may be possible
for <i class="application">apcnis</i> to die, in which case, though it
is not supposed to, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> may also exit,
thus leaving your machine without shutdown protection. In addition,
since <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is running at root level, all
threads or any child process will do so also. That being said, most of
us prefer to run the server this way.</p><p>With <i class="application">apcupsd</i> version 3.8.2 and later,
you may enable the TCP Libwrap subroutines to add additional
security. In this case, access to the network server will be
controlled by the statements you put in
<tt class="filename">/etc/hosts.allow</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2894461"></a>Running apcnisd from INETD</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>This is probably the most secure and most desirable way of
running the network information server. Unfortunately, it is a bit
more complicated to set up. However, once running, the server remains
unexecuted until a connection is attempted, at which point, inetd will
invoke <i class="application">apcnisd</i>. Once
<i class="application">apcnisd</i> has responded to the client's
requests, it will exit. None of the disadvantages of running it
standalone apply since <i class="application">apcnisd</i> runs only
when a client is requesting data. Note, running in this manner works
only if you are using the old forking code and have pthreads
explicitly turned off. The pthreads version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> does not support the shared memory
calls that are necessary for <i class="application">apcnisd</i> to
access the internal state of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>.</p><p>An additional advantage of this method of running the network
information server is that you can call it with a TCP wrapper and thus
use access control lists (ACL) such as
<tt class="filename">hosts.allow</tt>. See the man pages for
<tt class="filename">hosts.allow</tt> for more details.</p><p>To configure <i class="application">apcnisd</i> to run from
INETD, you must first put an entry in
<tt class="filename">/etc/services</tt> as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
apcnisd         3551/tcp
</pre><p>This defines the port number (3551) and the service (TCP) that
<i class="application">apcnisd</i> will be using. This statement can
go anywhere in the services file. Normally, one adds local changes
such as these to the end of the file.</p><p>Next, you must modify <tt class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</tt> to have the
following line:</p><pre class="programlisting">
apcnisd stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  /sbin/apcnisd -i
</pre><p>If you do not want to run the TCP wrapper, then the line should
be entered as follows (not tested):</p><pre class="programlisting">
apcnisd stream  tcp     nowait  root    /sbin/apcnisd -i
</pre><p>Please check that the file locations are correct for your
system. Also, note that the <tt class="option">-i</tt> option is necessary so
that <i class="application">apcnisd</i> knows that it was called by
INETD. Before restarting INETD, first ensure that the <span class="bold"><b>NETSERVER</b></span> directive in
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</tt> is set to <span class="bold"><b>off</b></span>. This is necessary to prevent
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> from starting a child process that
acts as a server. If you change <span class="bold"><b>NETSERVER</b></span>, you must stop and restart
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> for the configuration change to be
effective.</p><p>Finally, you must restart INETD for it to listen on port 3551.
On a Red Hat system, you can do so by:</p><pre class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/inet reload
</pre><p>At this point, when a client attempts to make a connection on
port 3551, INETD will automatically invoke
<i class="application">apcnisd</i>.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2894306"></a>Running <i class="application">apcnisd</i> Standalome</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>This is probably the least desirable of the three ways to run an
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> network information server because
if <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is stopped, you must also stop
<i class="application">apcnisd</i> before you can restart
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>. This is because
<i class="application">apcnisd</i>, when run standalone, holds the
shared memory buffer by which <i class="application">apcnisd</i> and

<span class="bold"><b>STATUS</b></span> logging, for compatibility,
with prior versions is still done to a file, and <span class="bold"><b>EVENTS</b></span> logging can be directed to a
&quot;temporary&quot; file so that it can be reported by the network
information server.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2895268"></a>Logging Types</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p><i class="application">apcupsd</i> splits its logging into four
separate types called:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>DEBUG</p></li><li><p>DATA</p></li><li><p>STATUS</p></li><li><p>EVENTS</p></li></ol></div><p>Debug logging consists of debug messages. Normally these are
turned on only by developers, and currently there exist very few of
these debug messages.</p><h3><a name="id2895493"></a>DATA Logging</h3><p>Data logging consists of periodically logging important data
concerning the operation of the UPS. See the <a href="manual.html#datalogging" title="Chapter&#xA0;25.&#xA0;DATA Logging">Data Logging</a> section of this manual for
more details.</p><h3><a name="id2895513"></a>STATUS Logging</h3><p>Status logging consists of logging all available information known
about your UPS as a series of ASCII records. This information is
also made available by the <i class="application">apcupsd</i> network
information server.</p><p>For more details on STATUS logging, see the <a href="manual.html#statusformat" title="Chapter&#xA0;27.&#xA0;apcupsd Status Logging">Status</a> section of the Technical
Reference.</p><h3><a name="id2895546"></a>EVENTS Logging</h3><p>Events logging consists of logging events as they happen. For
example, successful startup, power fail, battery failure, system
shutdown, ...</p><p>See the manual section on <a href="manual.html#events" title="Chapter&#xA0;11.&#xA0;Customizing Event Handling">customizing event
handling</a> for more details.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2896319"></a>Implementation Details</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>In order to ensure that the data logged to syslog() can be directed
to different files, I have assigned syslog() levels to each of our
four types of data as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>1. DEBUG logging has level LOG_DEBUG</p></li><li><p>2. DATA logging has level LOG_INFO</p></li><li><p>3. STATUS logging has level LOG_NOTICE</p></li><li><p>4. EVENTS logging has levels LOG_WARNING, LOG_ERR, 
LOG_CRIT, and LOG_ALERT</p></li></ol></div><p>It should be noted that more work needs to be done on the
precise definitions of each of the levels for EVENTS logging.
Currently, it is roughly broken down as follows:</p><p>LOG_WARNING general information such as startup, etc.</p><p>LOG_ERR an error condition detected, e.g. communications problem
with the UPS.</p><p>LOG_CRIT a serious problem has occurred such as power failure,
running on UPS batteries, ...</p><p>LOG_ALERT a condition that needs immediate attention such as
pending system shutdown, ...</p><p>The default Facility for syslog() logging is DAEMON, although this
can be changed with the FACILITY directive in apcupsd.conf. In the
following example, we should the facility as local0.</p><p>More work needs to be done to the code to ensure that it
corresponds to the above levels.</p><p>As a practical example of how to setup your syslog() to use the
new logging feature, suppose you wish to direct all DATA logging to a
file named <tt class="filename">/var/log/apcupsd.data</tt>, all EVENTS to
the standard <tt class="filename">/var/log/messages</tt> file (to be mixed
with other system messages), and at the same time send all EVENTS to
<tt class="filename">/var/log/apcupsd.events</tt>, and finally, you want to
send all STATUS logging to the named pipe
<tt class="filename">/var/log/apcupsd.status</tt></p><p>First as root, you create the named pipe:</p><pre class="programlisting">
mkfifo /var/log/apcupsd.status
</pre><p>Change its permissions as necessary or use the -m option to set
them when creating the pipe.</p><p>Then you modify your <tt class="filename">/etc/syslog.conf</tt> file
to direct the appropriate levels of messages where you want them. To
accomplish the above, my syslog.conf file looks like:</p><pre class="programlisting">
# exclude all apcupsd info by default
*.info;local0.none                    /var/log/messages

# Everything for apcupsd goes here
local0.info;local0.!notice             /var/log/apcupsd.data
local0.notice;local0.!warn            |/var/log/apcupsd.status
local0.warn                            /var/log/apcupsd.events
local0.warn                            /var/log/messages
</pre></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2895363"></a>Developer's Notes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>All logging functions and all error reporting are now done
through the log_event() subroutine call. Exceptions to this are:
initialization code where printf's are done, and writing to the
status file. Once the initialization code has completed and the
fork() to become a daemon is done, no printf's are used.
log_event() has exactly the same format as syslog(). In fact, the
subroutine consists of only a syslog() call. If anyone really
wishes to log to a file, the code to do so can easily be done by
adding code to log_event() in apclog.c.</p></div></div></div><div class="part" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="win32"></a>Installation: Windows</h1></div></div><div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt>17. <a href="manual.html#id2896295">The Windows Version of apcupsd</a></dt><dd><dl><dt><a href="manual.html#id2896227">Installation</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2897820">Installation Directory</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2897862">Testing</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2897909">Upgrading</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2897420">Post

been tested on Win95, Win98, WinMe, WinNT, WinXP, and Win2000
systems. This version of <i class="application">apcupsd</i> has been
built to run under the CYGWIN environment, which provides many of the
features of Unix on Windows systems. It also permitted a rapid port
with very few source code changes, which means that the Windows
version is for the most part running code that has long proved stable
on Unix systems. Even though the Win32 version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> is a port that relies on many Unix
features, it is just the same a true Windows program. When running, it
is perfectly integrated with Windows and displays its icon in the
system icon tray, and provides a system tray menu to obtain additional
information on how <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is running
(status and events dialogue boxes). If so desired, it can also be
stopped by using the system tray menu, though this should normally
never be necessary.</p><p>Once installed <i class="application">apcupsd</i> normally runs
as a system service.  This means that it is immediately started by the
operating system when the system is booted, and runs in the background
even if there is no user logged into the system.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2896227"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Normally, you will install the Windows version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> from the binaries. This install is
somewhat Unix like since you do many parts of the installation by
hand. To install the binaries, you need <span class="bold"><b>WinZip</b></span>.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Simply double click on the
  <tt class="filename">winapcupsd-3.8.5.tar.gz</tt> icon.  The actual name

will need to proceed with a manual installation, which is not
particularly easy as you must rebuild the source and change the
configuration file as well.</p><p>This installation assumes that you do <span class="bold"><b>not</b></span> have CYGWIN installed on your computer. If
you do, and you use mount points, you may need to do a special manual
installation.</p><p>Once you have unzipped the binaries, open a window pointing to
the binary installation folder (normally
<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd</tt>). This folder should contain folders
with the name bin, etc, examples, and manual. If and when you no
longer need them, the examples and manual sub-folders of the
<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd</tt> directory may be removed.</p><p>Continuing the installation process:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Open the directory <tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd</tt>
    in the Windows Explorer by Clicking on the apcupsd folder then on the
    <tt class="filename">etc</tt> folder, then on the apcupsd folder. Finally
    double click on the file <tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> and edit it
    to contain the values appropriate for your site. In most cases, no
    changes will be needed, but if you are not using COM1 for your serial
    port, you will need to set the <span class="bold"><b>DEVICE</b></span>
    configuration directive to the correct serial port. Note, if you are
    using WinNT or Win2000, the operating system may probe the port
    attempting to attach a serial mouse. This will cause
    <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to be unable to communicate with
    the serial port. If this happens, or out of precaution, you can edit
    the <tt class="filename">c:\boot.ini</tt> file. Find the line that looks
    something like the following:</p><p>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT=&quot;Windows NT
    Workstation Version 4.00&quot;</p><p>and add the following to the end of the line: /NoSerialMice:COM1
    (or COM2 depending on what you want to use). The new line should
    look similar to:</p><p>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT=&quot;Windows NT
    Workstation Version 4.00&quot; /NoSerialMice:COM1</p><p>where the only thing you have changed is to append to the end of
    the line. This addition will prevent the operating system from
    interferring with <i class="application">apcupsd</i></p></li><li><p>Then return to <tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd</tt> and open on the
    <tt class="filename">bin</tt> folder so that you see its contents.</p></li><li><p>To do the final step of installation, double click on the

    <i class="application">apcupsd</i> in the system registry, and on
    Windows 98, it will start <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
    running.</p><p>If everything went well, you will get something similar to the

    because your DEVICE statement does not contain the correct serial
    port name.</p></li></ul></div><p>You probably should also click on the <span class="bold"><b>Startup...</b></span> button to ensure that the correct
defaults are set. The dialogue box that appears should have <span class="bold"><b>Startup Type</b></span> set to <span class="bold"><b>Automatic</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>Logon</b></span> should be set to <span class="bold"><b>System Account</b></span> with <span class="bold"><b>Allow

are not set correctly by default, please change them otherwise
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> will not work.</p><p>For WinXP systems (and probably Win2K), the dialogs are a bit
different from those shown here for WinNT, but he concept is the
same. You get to the Services dialog by clicking on: <span class="bold"><b>Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Component
Services</b></span>. The <i class="application">apcupsd</i> service
should appear in the right hand window when you click on <span class="bold"><b>Services (Local)</b></span> in the left hand menu

on it and a menu will appear. Select the <span class="bold"><b>Events</b></span> item, and the Events dialogue box should
appear. There should be no error messages. By right clicking again on
the system tray plug and selecting the <span class="bold"><b>Status</b></span> item, you can verify that all the values
for your UPS are correct.</p><p>When the UPS switches to the battery, the battery icon will
reappear in the system tray. While the UPS is online, if the battery
is not at least 99% charged, the plug icon will become a plug with a
lightning bolt in the middle
<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="charging.png" width="16" /></span> to indicate

<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apcupsd.events</tt> where apcupsd
normally logs its events, and you will generally find more detailed

stop <i class="application">apcupsd</i> by using the tray icon and
selecting the <span class="bold"><b>Close
<i class="application">apcupsd</i></b></span> menu item, or by double
clicking on the <span class="bold"><b>Stop</b></span> icon located in
the <tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\bin</tt> directory, then apply the
upgrade and restart <i class="application">apcupsd</i>.</p><p>On WinNT systems (and Win2000 systems), you may stop
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> as indicated abover or
alternatively you may stop <i class="application">apcupsd</i> by using
the <span class="bold"><b>Services</b></span> item in the <span class="bold"><b>Control Panel</b></span>. In addition, at least on my
system, there seems to be a WinNT bug that causes the system to
prevent <span class="bold"><b>apcupsd.exe</b></span> from being
overwritten even though the file is no longer being used.  This is
manifested by an error message when attempting load a new version and
overwrite the old <i class="application">apcupsd.exe</i> (the extract
part of WinZip as described above). To circumvent this problem (if it
happens to you), after shutting down the running version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>, through the <span class="bold"><b>Services</b></span> dialogue in the <span class="bold"><b>Control Panel</b></span>, first click on the <span class="bold"><b>Stop button</b></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="672"><tr style="height: 339px"><td><img src="wininstall6.png" height="339" /></td></tr></table></div><p>then click on the <span class="bold"><b>Startup ...</b></span>

Microsoft :-(. When the system comes back up,
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> will not be automatically launched
as a service, and you can install the new version. To reinstate
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> as an automatic service, using the
<span class="bold"><b>Control Panel</b></span>: reset
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to <span class="bold"><b>Automatic</b></span> startup in the Startup dialogue, then
restart <i class="application">apcupsd</i> in the <span class="bold"><b>Services</b></span> dialogue as shown above in the
installation instructions. Frequently after an upgrade, you will click
on the <span class="bold"><b>Start</b></span> button and after a few
seconds, the system reports that it failed to start. The cause of this
problem is unknown, but the solution is simply to click again on the

Installation</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>After installing <i class="application">apcupsd</i> and before
running it, you should check the contents of two files to ensure that
it is configured properly for your system. The first is
<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apcupsd.conf</tt>. You will
probably need to change your UPSCABLE directive, your UPSTYPE and
possibly your DEVICE directives. Please refer to the configuration
section of this manual for more details.</p><p>The second file that you should examine is
<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol</tt>. This file is
called by <i class="application">apcupsd</i> when events (power loss,
etc) are generated. It permits the user to program handling the
event. In particular, it permits the user to be notified of the
events. For the Win32 version, each event is programmed to display a
Windows popup dialogue box. If your machine is mostly unattended, you
may want to comment out some of these popup dialogue boxes by putting
a pound sign (#) in column one of the appropriate line.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2897477"></a>Problem Areas</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>In addition to possible problems of reinstallation or upgrade on
WinNT systems, as noted above, we have discovered the following
problem: On some Windows systems, the domain resolution does not seem
to work if you have not configured a DNS server in the Network section
of the Control Panel. This problem should be apparent only when
running a master or a slave configuration. In this case, when you
specify the name of the master or the slave machine(s) in your
<tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> file, apcupsd will be unable to
resolve the name to a valid IP address. To circumvent this problem,
simply enter all machine addresses as an IP address rather than a
domain name, or alternatively, ensure that you have a valid DNS server
configured on your system (often not the case on Win32 systems).  For
example, instead of using the directive &quot;MASTER
my.master.com&quot; use something like &quot;MASTER 192.168.1.54&quot;
where you replace the IP address with your actual IP address.</p><p>Also, on WinNT systems, the PIF files in
<tt class="filename">/apcupsd/bin</tt> used for starting and stopping
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> do not work. Use the services
control panel instead.</p><p>On Win95 systems, there are reports that the PIF files do not
work. If you find that to be the case, the simplest solution is to use
the batch files that we have supplied in the
<tt class="filename">c:/apcupsd/bin</tt> directory. Also, on Win95 systems,
we have an unconfirmed report that indicates that
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> does not start automatically as a
service even though the Registry has been properly updated. If you
experience this problem, a work around is to put a shortcut to
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> in the StartUp folder.</p><p>As noted above, after an upgrade, you may need to start
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> several times before it will
actually run.</p><p>On WinNT, WinXP, and Win2K systems, you can examine the System

Windows error messages during startup.</p><p>Regardless of which Windows system you are running,
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> logs most error messages to

utility routines (actually .pif files) that you may find useful. They
are:</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>Any of these utilities may be used on any system, with the
exception of the Start utility, which cannot be used on WinNT and
Win2000 systems. On those systems, the apcupsd service must always be
started through the <span class="bold"><b>Services</b></span>
sub-dialogue of the <span class="bold"><b>Control
Panel</b></span>.</p><p>The <span class="bold"><b>Install</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>Uninstall</b></span> utilities install and uninstall
apcupsd from the system registry only. All other pieces (files) of
apcupsd remain intact. It is not absolutely necessary for apcupsd to
be installed in the registry as it can run as a regular
program. However, if it is not installed in the registry, it cannot be
run as a service.</p><p>The functions of <span class="bold"><b>Stop</b></span>,
<span class="bold"><b>ups-events</b></span>, and <span class="bold"><b>ups-status</b></span> can be more easily invoked by right
clicking on the apcupsd icon in the system tray and selecting the

exhaustively tested on Win32 systems. If at all possible, we
recommend not to use it as a network master on Win95, Win98, and
WinMe due to the instability of those operating systems.</p><p>Some items to note:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>This version of apcupsd will not attempt to shut off the
    UPS power when the battery is exhausted. Thus if the power returns
    before the UPS completely shuts down, your computer may not reboot
    automatically. This is because we do not know how to regain control
    after the disks have been synced in order to shut off the UPS
    power.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is possible to use the
    <tt class="option">--kill-on-powerfail</tt> option on the apcupsd command
    line, but the use of this option could cause the power to be cut
    off while your machine is still running. See <a href="manual.html#shutdown" title="Shutdown Sequence">the section called “Shutdown Sequence”</a> of this document for a more complete
    discussion of this subject. If you are still interested in trying
    to get this to work, please look at the code that is commented out
    in <tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol</tt> under
    the <span class="bold"><b>doshutdown</b></span> case.</p><p>An alternative to the <tt class="option">--kill-on-powerfail</tt>
    option is to use the <a href="manual.html#KILLDELAY">KILLDELAY</a>
    configuration directive.</p><p>This configuration directive is appropriate on Windows machines
    where apcupsd continues to run even when the machine is
    halted (as is the case on most NT machines).</p></li><li><p>When apcupsd detects important events, it calls
    <tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol</tt>, which is a
    Unix shell script. You may modify this script to suit your
    particular needs.  Currently, it puts a Windows dialogue on the
    screen with a brief explanation of the event. If these dialogues
    annoy you, you can remove or comment out the calls to <span class="bold"><b>popup</b></span> from this file.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2898921"></a>Email Notification of Events</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>On Win95/98 systems, it is possible to receive notification of
apcupsd events that are passed to
<i class="application">apccontrol</i>. This is possible using a simple
email program that unfortunately is not functioning 100% correctly. In
addition, I (Kern) was not able to make this program work on WinNT
while apcupsd is running as a service under the system account (it
works fine with any user account).</p><p>If you wish to try this program on Win95/98 systems, look at the
files named <span class="bold"><b>changeme, commfailure, commok,
onbattery, and mainsback</b></span> in the directory
<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\examples</tt>. To use them, you must modify
the SYSADMIN variable to have a valid email address, then copy the
files into the directory
<tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2898975"></a>Killpower under Windows</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>If your batteries become exhausted during a power failure and
you want your machine to automatically reboot when the power comes
back, it is useful to implement the
<i class="application">killpower</i> feature of the UPS where apcupsd
sends the UPS the command to shut off the power.  In doing so, the
power will be cut to your PC and if your BIOS is properly setup, the
machine will automatically reboot when the power comes back. This is
important for servers.</p><p>This feature is implemented on Unix systems by first requesting
a system shutdown. As a part of the shutdown, apcupsd is terminated
by the system, but the shutdown process executes a script where
apcupsd is recalled after the disks are synced and the machine is
idle. Bacula then requests the UPS to shut off the power
(killpower).</p><p>Unfortunately on Windows, there is no such shutdown script that
we are aware of and no way for apcupsd to get control after the
machine is idled. If this feature is important to you, it is
possible to do it by telling apcupsd to immediately issue the
killpower command after issuing the shutdown request. The danger in
doing so is that if the machine is not sufficiently idled when the
killpower takes place, the disks will need to be rescanned (and
there is a possibility of lost data however small). Generally,
UPSes have a shutdown grace period which gives sufficient time for
the OS to shutdown before the power is cut.</p><p>To implement this feature, you need to add the
<tt class="option">-p</tt> option to the apcupsd command line that is
executed by the system.  Currently the procedure is manual. You do so
by editing the registry and changing the line:</p><pre class="programlisting">
c:\apcupsd\apcupsd.exe /service
</pre><p>found under the key:</p><pre class="programlisting">
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
</pre><p>to</p><pre class="programlisting">
c:\apcupsd\apcupsd.exe /service -p
</pre><p>If you have a Smart UPS, you can configure the kill power grace
period, and you might want to set it to 3 minutes. If you have a
dumb UPS, there is no grace period and you should not use this
procedure. If you have a Back-UPS CS or ES, these UPSes generally
have a fixed grace period of 2 minutes, which is probably
sufficient.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2899082"></a>Power Down During Shutdown</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Our philosophy is to shutdown a computer but not to power it down
itself (as opposed to having the UPS cut the power as described
above). That is we prefer to idle a computer but leave it running.
This has the advantage that in a power fail situation, if the
killpower function described above does not work, the computer will
continue to draw down the batteries and the UPS will hopefully
shutoff before the power is restore thus permitting an automatic
reboot. </p><p>Nevertheless some people prefer to do a full power down. To do
so, you might want to get a copy of PsShutdown, which does have a
power down option. You can find it and a lot more useful software at:
<a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml" target="_top">http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/pstools.shtml</a>.
to use their shutdown program rather than the apcupsd supplied
version, you simply edit:</p><pre class="programlisting">
c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apccontrol
</pre><p>with any text editor and change our calls to shutdown to
psshutdown.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2899134"></a>Command Line Options Specific to the Windows Version</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>These options are not normally seen or used by the user, and are

do two things before you can even think about configuring the
software. First, you need to figure out whether it's a dumb
(voltage-signalling) UPS or speaks the apcsmart protocol (see <a href="manual.html#upstypes">this discussion</a>).  Second, if you have an
interface cable from APC, you need to figure out what kind it is.  If
you don't have such a cable, you need to build one.  A
straight-through serial cable <a href="manual.html#crazy">won't
work</a>.</p><p>According to Bill Marr the Belkin F5U109, also sold as
F5U409 also works with apcupsd for kernel versions 2.4.25 or
higher and kernels 2.6.1 and higher.  These newer kernels are
needed to have the patch that makes the mtc_u232 module and other
adapters work with RS-232 devices that do not assert the CTS
signal.</p></div><div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="id2900804"></a>Chapter&nspb;&nspb;19.&nspb;&nspb;Connecting a Serial-Line UPS to a USB Port</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>By using a special adaptor, you can connect your serial-line UPS
to a USB port. If you would like to free up your serial port and
connect your existing serial port UPS to a USB port, it is possible if
you have one of the later kernels. You simply get a serial to USB
adapter that is supported by the kernel, plug it in and make one minor
change to your <tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> file and away you
go. (Kern adds: Thanks to Joe Acosta for pointing this out to
me.)</p><p>The device that Joe Acosta and Kern are using is IOgear GUC232A USB 2
serial adapter. Bill Marr
informs us that it also works with a Back-UPS Pro 640 and the 940-0095B
cable.</p><p>At Kern's site, running Red Hat 7.1 with kernel 2.4.9-12, he
simply changed his <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</tt>

the USB ports (actually an RJ45 connector) on APC UPSes not only speak
USB, but also serial apcsmart and dumb voltage-signalling as well!
This is something that one of our users discovered by accident. With the

power for the circuit. It is used as the Vcc pull-up voltage for
testing the outputs on any &quot;UPS by APC&quot; in voltage-signalling
mode.  This cable may not work on a BackUPS Pro if the default
communications are in apcsmart mode. This cable is also valid for
&quot;ShareUPS&quot; BASIC Port mode and is also reported to work on
SmartUPSes. However, the Smart Cable described above is much
simpler. To have a better idea of what is going on inside
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>, for the SIMPLE cable
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> reads three signals and sets
three:</p><pre class="programlisting">
Reads:
CD, which apcupsd uses for the On Battery signal when high.

CTS, which apcupsd uses for the Battery Low signal when high.

RxD (SR), which apcupsd uses for the Line Down 
    signal when high. This signal isn't used for much.

Sets:
DTR, which apcupsd sets when it detects a power failure (generally
     5 to 10 seconds after the CD signal goes high). It
     clears this signal if the CD signal subsequently goes low
     -- i.e. power is restored.

TxD (ST), which apcupsd clears when it detects that the CD signal
     has gone low after having gone high - i.e. power is restored.

RTS, which apcupsd sets for the killpower signal -- to cause the UPS
     to shut off the power.
</pre><p>Please note that these actions apply only to the SIMPLE cable,
the signals used on the other cables are different.</p><p>Finally, here is another way of looking at the CUSTOM-SIMPLE
cable:</p><pre class="programlisting">

signals on the output pins of the UPS. The difference at the computer
end is due to different cable configurations. Thus, by measuring the
connectivity of a cable, one can determine how to program the UPS.
This is to be verified.</p><p>The signals presented or accepted by the UPS on its DB9
connector using the numbering scheme listed above is:</p><pre class="programlisting">

 1     &lt;-     Shutdown when set by computer for 1-5 seconds.
 2     -&gt;     On battery power (this signal is normally low but
                    goes high when the UPS switches to batteries).
 3     -&gt;     Mains down (line fail) See Note 1 below.
 5     -&gt;     Low battery. See Note 1 below.
 6     -&gt;     Inverse of mains down signal. See Note 2 below.
 7     &lt;-     Turn on/off power (only on advanced UPSes only)

 Note 1: these two lines are normally open, but close when the
     appropriate signal is triggered. In fact, they are open collector
     outputs which are rated for a maximum of +40VDC and 25 mA. Thus
     the 4.7K ohm resistor used in the Custom Simple cable works 
     quite well.

 Note 2: the same as note 1 except that the line is normally closed,
     and opens when the line voltage fails.

Operation:

* DTR is &quot;cable power&quot; and must be held at SPACE.  DSR or CTS may be
used as a loopback input to determine if the cable is plugged in.

* DCD is the &quot;battery low&quot; signal to the computer.  A SPACE on this
line means the battery is low.  This is signalled by BATTERY-LOW
being pulled down (it is probably open circuit normally).

Normally, the transistor is turned off, and DCD is held at the MARK
voltage by TxD.  When BATTERY-LOW is pulled down, the voltage
divider R2/R1 biases the transistor so that it is turned on, causing
DCD to be pulled up to the SPACE voltage.

* TxD must be held at MARK; this is the default state when no data is
being transmitted.  This sets the default bias for both DCD and
SHUTDOWN.  If this line is an open circuit, then when BATTERY-LOW is
signalled, SHUTDOWN will be automatically signalled; this would be
true if the cable were plugged in to the UPS and not the computer,
or if the computer were turned off.

* RTS is the &quot;shutdown&quot; signal from the computer.  A SPACE on this
line tells the UPS to shut down.

* RxD and RI are both the &quot;power-fail&quot; signals to the computer.  A
MARK on this line means the power has failed.

* SPACE is a positive voltage, typically +12V.  MARK is a negative
voltage, typically -12V.  Linux appears to translate SPACE to a 1
and MARK to a 0.

(typically with a green DB9 F connector) that has 940-0128A stamped
into one side of the plastic serial port connector. The other end of
the cable is a 10 pin RJ45 connector that plugs into the UPS (thanks
to Dean Waldow for sending me a cable!). Apcupsd version 3.8.5 and
later supports this cable when specified as <span class="bold"><b>UPSCABLE 940-0128A</b></span> and <span class="bold"><b>UPSTYPE backups</b></span>. However, running in this mode
much of the information that would be available in USB mode is
lost. In addition, when <i class="application">apcupsd</i> attempts to
instruct the UPS to kill the power, it begins cycling about 4 times a
second between battery and line. The solution to the problem (thanks
to Tom Suzda) is to unplug the UPS and while it is still chattering,
press the power button (on the front of the unit) until the unit beeps
and the chattering stops. After that the UPS should behave normally
and power down 1-2 minutes after requested to do so.</p><p>An amazing discovery by slither_man allows one to build a
CUSTOM-RJ45 cable (documented above) and run the BackUPS CS (and
probably also the ES) in Smart mode. Running it this way provides
all the same information that you would get by running it in USB
mode. As a consequence, we recommend that you either purchase
(where I don't know) or build your own CUSTOM-RJ45 cable rather
than use the 940-0128A cable.</p><p>Thanks to all the people who have helped test this and have
provided information on the cable wiring, our best guess for the
cable schematic is the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">

run before the general ones described in the <a href="manual.html#testing" title="Chapter&#xA0;5.&#xA0;Testing Apcupsd">Testing</a> section.</p><p>To test your computer's connection with a serial-line UPS, you first
need to establish that the serial line is functioning, and then that the
UPS is responding to commands.  This can be a bit tricky, especially
with a dumb voltage-signalling interface, because it is completely
quiescent when there are no commands being passed, and the command 
repertoire doesn't include any self-tests.</p><p>Because it is easy to configure a serial cable incorrectly in
such a way as to cause premature shutdowns of the UPS power, we
<span class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span> recommend, especially for voltage-
signaling (dumb) UPSes, that you do most of the initial testing with
your computer plugged into the wall rather than your UPS. Thus if the
UPS power is suddenly shut off, your computer will continue to run. We
also recommend using <i class="application">safe-apccontrol</i> as
described below, until you are sure that the signaling is
correct.</p><p>Also note that if you launch the execution of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> while your voltage-signaling UPS is
on battery power, it is very likely that your UPS will immediately
shut off the power. This is due to the initialization of the serial
port line signals, which often looks to the UPS like a shutdown
command.</p><p>Finally, double-check the state of your cabling and UPS
indicator lights frequently during testing.  For voltage-signaling
UPSes, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is not currently able to
detect whether or not the serial cable is connected. In addition, some
simple signaling UPSes with certain cable combinations are not able to
detect the low battery condition.  For more details please see
<a href="manual.html#CableModes" title="Voltage Signalling&#10;Features Supported by Apcupsd for Various Cables">the section called “Voltage Signalling
Features Supported by Apcupsd for Various Cables”</a>.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2904537"></a>Establishing Serial Port Connection</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Once you have compiled, installed, and invoked
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>, you should wait to allow
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to configure itself and establish
contact with the UPS.</p><p>If you see the following message about 30 seconds after starting
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>:</p><pre class="programlisting">
apcupsd FATAL ERROR in apcserial.c at line 156
PANIC! Cannot communicate with UPS via serial port.
</pre><p>it means that <i class="application">apcupsd</i> tried for about
30 seconds to establish contact with the UPS via the serial port, but
was unable to do so. Before continuing, you must correct this
problem. Some of the possible sources of the problem are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You have not configured the correct serial port name on the 
    DEVICE directive in your <tt class="filename">apcupsd</tt> configuration 
    file.</p></li><li><p>The serial port that you have chosen has logins enabled. You must 
    disable logins on that port, otherwise, the system prevents 
    <i class="application">apcupsd</i> from using it.
    Normally, the file <tt class="filename">/etc/inittab</tt> specifies the
    ports for which a <i class="application">getty</i> process is started 
    (on Sun machines, the serial port program equivalent to 
    <i class="application">getty</i> is called 
    <i class="application">ttymon</i>). You must disable this for the port
    that you wish to use.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you are doing your testing as 
    <span class="bold"><b>root</b></span> otherwise, you may have permissions
    problems accessing the serial port.</p></li><li><p>You may have cabling problems, either with an incorrect cable, or the
    incorrect cable specification directive in the configuration file.</p></li><li><p>You may have a problem with the 
    <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/acpupsd.conf</tt> file. For example, check 
    that you have specified the correct type of UPS and the correct networking
    directives.  For more details, see the 
    <a href="manual.html#after_installation" title="Chapter&#xA0;3.&#xA0;After Installation">Chapter&nspb;&nspb;3, <i>After Installation</i></a>.</p></li><li><p>If you have a SmartUPS 5000 RM 15U or similar model, that comes 
    with a &quot;Web/SNMP management card&quot; in one of the &quot;Smart
    Slots&quot;, this card may interfere with the serial port operation. 
    If you are having problems, please remove this card and try again. 
    Supposedly V3.0 of the card firmware has been corrected to properly
    release the serial port.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that you have no other programs that are using the serial 
    port. One user reported that he had problems because the serial port
    mouse (gpm) was using the same port as <i class="application">apcupsd</i>.
    This causes intermittent seemingly random problems.</p></li><li><p>If you are using a WinNT or Win2000 machine, the OS is probably
    attempting to attach a serial mouse to the port you are using (COM1 or 
    COM2). To prevent this, edit your <tt class="filename">c:\boot.ini</tt> file, 
    and you will find a line that looks something like the following:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT=&quot;Windows NT Workstation Version 4.00&quot;
</pre><p>

    Add the following to the end of the line: 
    <tt class="filename">/NoSerialMice:COM1</tt> (or COM2) so that the new line
    looks like:</p><pre class="programlisting">
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT=&quot;Windows NT Workstation Version 4.00&quot; /NoSerialMice:COM1
</pre></li><li><p>If you are using a WinNT or Win2000 machine, try connecting 
    <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to COM2 rather than COM1 (be sure to 
    change your <tt class="filename">c:\apcupsd\etc\apcupsd\apcupsd.conf</tt> to
    reflect the change).</p></li><li><p>If you are using a Solaris machine, you may have similar problems 
    as described above for the WinNT machine. A possible fix is documented
    in the Sun section of the Configuration chapter of this manual.</p></li><li><p>Try connecting your UPS to another machine. If it works, then you
    probably have a bad serial port card. As unlikely as this may sound, at
    least two of our users have had to replace bad serial port cards.</p></li><li><p>Try doing an <b class="command">lsof /dev/ttyS0</b> where you replace
    the <span class="bold"><b>/dev/ttyS0</b></span> with your serial port
    name. If you get no output, the port is free (or there is no physical
    port). If you get output, then another program is using the port, and
    you should see which one.</p></li><li><p>Try doing a <b class="command">dmesg | grep tty</b>. This may show 
    you if a program has grabbed the port. (Thanks to Joe Acosta for the 
    suggestion.)</p></li><li><p>If all else fails, make sure your system is configured for serial 
    port support.</p></li><li><p>If you are running Linux, check your <tt class="filename">/proc</tt> 
    file system. For example: <b class="command">cat /proc/devices</b> should 
    print something like <span class="emphasis"><em>4 ttyS</em></span> if you have a serial
    port. If your serial port is working, a <b class="command">cat 
    /proc/interrupts</b> should show the serial port usage (e.g. 
    <span class="bold"><b>4: 294553 XT-PIC serial</b></span>) Also, 
    <b class="command">cat /proc/ioports</b> should show up something like 
    <span class="bold"><b>03f8-03ff : serial(auto)</b></span>. Or, 
    <b class="command">cat /proc/tty</b> should print a line like 
    <span class="bold"><b>serial /dev/ttyS 4 64-127 serial</b></span>. 
    Finally, a <b class="command">cat /proc/tty/driver/serial</b> should
    print something like the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">
serinfo:1.0 driver:5.05c revision:2001-07-08 
0: uart:16550A port:3F8 irq:4 baud:9600 tx:1503168 rx:1461721 fe:8
</pre></li></ul></div><p>The first thing to do is to look at your log file, usually
<tt class="filename">/var/log/messages</tt> because
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> writes more detailed information to
the log file whenever there is an error.</p><p>If you have a UPS that uses apcsmart protcol (see <a href="manual.html#type_table">table of types</a> for a list of the UPSes
using these protocols), you can manually test the serial
communications with the UPS by starting a serial port communications
program (such as <i class="application">minicom</i>,
<i class="application">tip</i>, or <i class="application">cu</i>) with
the settings 2400 8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). Be
extremely careful what you send to your UPS as certain characters may
cause it to power down or may even cause damage to the UPS. Try
sending an upper case Y to the UPS (without a return at the end). It
should respond with SM. If this is not the case, review the possible
problems listed above. If you fat finger the Y and enter y instead, no
cause for alarm, you will simply get the APC copyright notice.</p><p>Once you are sure that serial port communications is working,
proceed to the next test.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="serial_apctest"></a>Using <i class="application">apctest</i> on

Hello, this is the apcupsd Cable Test program.
This part of apctest is for testing dumb UPSes (ones that uses signaling rather than commands.
Most tests enter a loop polling every second for 10 seconds.
</pre><p>Then it will present you with the following list of choices: </p><pre class="programlisting">
1) Test 1 - normal mode
2) Test 2 - no cable
3) Test 3 - no power
4) Test 4 - low battery (requires test 3 first)
5) Test 5 - battery exhausted
6) Test 6 - kill UPS power
7) Test 7 - run tests 1 through 5
8) Guess which is the appropriate cable
9) quit

Select test number: 
</pre><p>Run tests 1, 2, and 3. Note, none of the currently supported cables
will indicate a change for test 2. You can then run test 8 to see
what cable it thinks you should be using. Finally run test 4.</p><p>apctest can also be run for Smart UPSes.</p><p>The print out of your testing will be written to the file
<tt class="filename">apctest.output</tt>. If you are unable to solve your
problem, you can try posting that file to the development mailing
list, and perhaps we can help you. In this case, please also include
information on your operating system, which version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> you are using, your UPS model, and
also your <tt class="filename">apcupsd.conf</tt> file.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2800618"></a>Expected <i class="application">apctest</i> Signals for a UPS</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>If you have configured your UPS as:</p><pre class="programlisting">

this procedure will be replaced by a daemon operation that can be
performed on all types of UPS.</p><p>This section does not apply to voltage-signalling or dumb UPSes
such as the older BackUPS models.</p><p>Smart UPSes internally compute the remaining runtime, and
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> uses the value supplied by the
UPS. As the batteries age (after say two or three years), the runtime
computation may no longer be accurate since the batteries no longer
hold the same charge. As a consequence, in the event of a power
failure, the UPS and thus <i class="application">apcupsd</i> can
report a runtime of 5 minutes remaining when in fact only one minute
remains. This can lead to a shutdown before you might expect it,
because regardless of the runtime remaining that is reported, the UPS
will always correctly detect low batteries and report it, thus causing
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to correctly shutdown your
computer.</p><p>If you wish to have the UPS recalibrate the remaining runtime
calculations, you can do so manually as the current version of
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> does not support this feature. To
do so,</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Shutdown <i class="application">apcupsd</i></p></li><li><p>contact your UPS directly using some terminal program such as
    <i class="application">minicom</i>, <i class="application">tip</i>, or <i class="application">cu</i> with the settings 2400 8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits,
no parity, 1 stop bit). Be extremely careful what you send to your
UPS as certain characters may cause it to power down or may even
cause damage to the UPS. Try sending an upper case Y to the UPS
(without a return at the end). It should respond with SM. If this
is not the case, read the chapter on testing. If you fat finger the
Y and enter y instead, no cause for alarm, you will simply get the
APC copyright notice.</p></li><li><p>when you are sure you are properly connected send an upper case
D (no cr). This will put the UPS into calibration mode, and it will
drain the battery down to 25% capacity (35% for a Matrix) at which
point it will go back on the mains. In doing so, it will recompute
the runtime calibration.</p></li><li><p>If you wish to abort the calibration, enter a second D command.</p></li><li><p>When you are done, restart <i class="application">apcupsd</i>.</p></li></ul></div><p>In principle, you should be able to do this with the computer
powered by the UPS, but if you wish to be completely safe, you should
plug your computer into the wall prior to performing the runtime
calibration. In that case, you will need to artificially load the UPS
with light bulbs or other means. You should supply a load of about 30
to 35% but not more than 50%. You can determine the load by looking at
the output of the <b class="command">apcaccess status</b> command while
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> is running.</p><p>You should not run the recalibration command more than once or
twice per year as discharging these kinds of batteries tends to
shorten their life span.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2906236"></a>Status Logging On Serial-Line UPSes</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Serial-line UPSes that speak the apcsmart protocol log all of

concerning the operation of the UPS. For the definitive definition
of the format, see log_data() in apcreports.c. The format varies
according to the UPS model and the information available from the
UPS.</p><p>For UPS models, NBKPRO, SMART, SHARESMART, and MATRIX, the
output is written in a format very similar to what PowerChute
writes. That is:</p><p>MinLineVoltage, MaxLineVoltage, OutputVoltage, BatteryVoltage,
LineFrequency, LoadPercent,
UPSTemperature,AmbientTemperature,Humidity,LineVoltage,
BatteryCharge,toggle</p><p>Any value that is not supported by your UPS such as
AmbientTemperature and Humidity will be blank or possibly as 0.0.
In any case the commas before and after that field will still be
output. The toggle value alternates from 0 to 1 on each line. This
was added at user request so that no two adjacent samples are
identical.</p><p>An actual example from the log file is:</p><pre class="programlisting">

<i class="application">apcupsd</i>'s status. This document describes
the format of that information.  Normally you will get at it via
<i class="application">apcaccess</i>, but there are other ways as
well.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2911671"></a>Status report format</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>The STATUS output is in ASCII format with a single data value or
piece of information on each line output. Because not all UPSes supply
the same information, the output varies based on the type of UPS that
you are using. In general, if the information is not available for
your UPS, the data portion of the output record will contain an
<span class="bold"><b>N/A</b></span> indicating that the information
is not available.</p><p>Status logging consists of periodically logging ALL available
information concerning the UPS. Since the volume of data is rather
large (over 1000 bytes per status), the STATUS data is not
automatically sent to the system log file, instead, it is written
as a series of data records to a specific file (normally
<tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status</tt>).</p><p>After each write, the file is rewound so that the size of the
file remains constant. At the current time, this file is 1135
bytes. The format of this file is very similar to the old
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> procfs file. The STATUS file is
kept for backward compatibility and will be eliminated in a future
version of <i class="application">apcupsd</i>. The preferred method
for obtaining this information is from
<i class="application">apcaccess</i> or by using the <a href="manual.html#cgiprogs" title="apcupsd Network Monitoring (CGI)&#10;Programs">CGI interface</a>.</p><p>To make reading the status data reliable via a named pipe, the
first record written contains a version number, the number of
records that follow the first record, and the total number of bytes
in those subsequent records. An actual example of such a status
file (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status) is:</p><p>Consequently, the first record always consists of 24 bytes (23
characters followed by a newline). This record starts with APC and
as indicated in the example above is followed by 28 records
consisting of 675 bytes. The last record begins with END APC and
contains the date and time matching the DATE record.</p><p>Documentation of each record needs to be written. In the coming
weeks, I plan to add additional records and possibly change the
names of some of the fields.</p><p>When this data is written to a file, it is written as two
records, the first record, and all the other records together. In
reading the file, it can be either be read a record at a time, or
in one big read.</p><p>When this data is written to syslog(), it is written a record at
a time. The first record is the first 24 bytes. By having the
number of records and the size in the first record, the complete
status can be reliably reassembled.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2911797"></a>Status Report Example</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>An example of output from an international SmartUPS 1000

be written to the system log file. Please note, that it would not
normally be wise to write this data to a normal system log file as
there is no mechanism in syslog() to rewind the file and hence the
log file would quickly become enormous. However, in two cases, it
can be very useful to use syslog() to write this information.</p><p>The first case is to set up your
<tt class="filename">syslog.conf</tt> file so that the data is written to a
named pipe. In this case, normally not more than about 8192 bytes of
data will be kept before it is discarded by the system.</p><p>The second case is to setup your syslog.conf file so that the
status data is sent to another machine, which presumably then
writes it to a named pipe. Consequently, with this mechanism,
provides a simple means of networking apcupsd STATUS
information.</p><p>Although we mention system logging of STATUS information, we
strongly recommend that you use  <i class="application">apcaccess</i>
or the CGI interface to get this information.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="id2914977"></a>Chapter&nspb;&nspb;28.&nspb;&nspb;The Shutown Sequence and its Discontents</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><a href="manual.html#shutdown">Shutdown Sequence</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2915983">Shutdown Problems</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2916004">Master/Slave Shutdown</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2915486">Startup</a></dt><dt><a href="manual.html#id2915604">Windows Considerations</a></dt></dl></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="shutdown"></a>Shutdown Sequence</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>If you experienced so problems with the testing procedures, or
if you are porting <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to another
system, or you are simply curious, you may want to know exactly what
is going on during the shutdown process.</p><p>The shutdown sequence is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><i class="application">apcupsd</i> detects that there is a
    power problem and it calls <b class="command">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol
    powerout</b>, which normally sends a message to all users
    informing them of a potential problem.</p></li><li><p>After approximately 5 seconds in the power problem mode,
    <i class="application">apcupsd</i> calls
    <b class="command">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol onbattery</b>, which
    normally sends a message to all users informing them that the UPS
    is on batteries.</p></li><li><p>When one of the conditions listed below occurs,
     <i class="application">apcupsd</i> issues a shutdown command by
     calling <b class="command">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol doshutdown</b>,
     which should perform a shutdown of your system using the system
     <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">shutdown</span>(8)</span>
     command. You can modify the behavior by editing the
     <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> script, but doing so
     will make it more complicated to upgrade to the next
     <i class="application">apcupsd</i> version.</p><p>The conditions that trigger the shutdown can be: running time on
     batteries have expired (TIMEOUT), the battery runtime remaining is
     below the configured value (BATTERYLEVEL), the estimated remaining
     runtime is below the configured value (MINUTES), or the UPS signals
     that the batteries are exhausted.</p><p>A shutdown could also be initiated if 
     <i class="application">apcupsd</i> detects
     that the batteries are no longer functioning correctly. This case,
     though very unusual, can happen at any time even if there is proper
     mains voltage, and <b class="command">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol emergency</b> is
     called.</p><p>Just before initiating any shutdown through the 
     <i class="application">apccontrol</i>
     script, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> will create the file
     <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/powerfail</tt>. This file will be
     used later in the shutdown sequence to recall 
     <i class="application">apcupsd</i> after syncing of the
     disks to initiate a power off of the UPS.</p><p>If the <tt class="filename">/etc/nologin</tt> file has not
     already been created, it will normally be created during the
     shutdown sequence to prevent additional users from logging in 
     (see the NOLOGIN configuration directive).</p><p>Even though <i class="application">apcupsd</i> has
     requested the system to perform a shutdown, it continues
     running. If it is a master with slaves, it will inform the slaves
     to do a shutdown. They perform their shutdown by calling
     <b class="command">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol remotedown</b>.</p></li><li><p>When the system signals <i class="application">apcupsd</i>
    to do exit, it does so.  This is part of the normal system
    shutdown (at least on Unix and Linux systems) and the exact time
    that <i class="application">apcupsd</i> receives the termination
    signal depends on how the shutdown links (usually in
    <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d</tt>) are set.</p><p>Note that on Windows NT systems,
    <i class="application">apcupsd</i> apparently continues to run as a
    Service even though the machine is &quot;shutdown&quot;.</p></li><li><p>During the shutdown of the system after
     <i class="application">apcupsd</i> has been forced to exit, one
     of the last things done by the system shutdown is to call the
     halt script, which is usually in
     <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/halt</tt> or
     <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</tt>, or possibly in
     <tt class="filename">/sbin/init.d/rc.0</tt> depending on your
     system. If apcupsd was properly installed, this standard halt
     script was modified to include a bit of new logic just before the
     final halt of the system. It first tests if the file
     <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/powerfail</tt> exists, and if it
     does, it executes <b class="command">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol
     killpower</b>. It is this last step that will cause
     <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to be re-executed with the
     <tt class="option">--killpower</tt> option on the command line. This
     option tells <i class="application">apcupsd</i> to inform the UPS
     to kill the power.</p><p>This final step is important if you want to ensure that your
     system will automatically reboot when the power comes back on. The
     actual code used on the Red Hat version is:</p><pre class="programlisting">

script. On many systems, such as Red Hat, all the disk drives were
unmounted, then remounted read-only, thus permitting access to the
<tt class="filename">/etc</tt> files and the
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> executable. If your system does not
explicitly remount the disks, you must remount them in read-only mode
in the code that you add. Examples of code fragments that do this can
be found in the <tt class="filename">distributions/suse</tt> subdirectory
of the source.</p><p>If you are not able to insert the above code in your halt script
because there is no halt script, or because your halt script calls the
<i class="application">init</i> program as some Unix systems do, you
can either just forget about powering off the UPS, which means that
your machine will not automatically reboot after a power failure, or
there is yet another alternative, though not at all as satisfying as
inserting code in the halt script.</p><p>Only if you cannot insert the appropriate code in the halt
script, when you start <i class="application">apcupsd</i>, normally
from the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd</tt> script, use the
<tt class="option">--kill-on-powerfail</tt> option. This will cause
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> to program the UPS to shutoff the
power just before it (<i class="application">apcupsd</i>) does the
system shutdown. Please note that this is not the most ideal solution.
Read on to understand why.</p><p>A very important consideration is that you must set the EEPROM
in your UPS so that it waits a sufficient time for the system to
halt before it shuts off the UPS power. The current value as well
as the permitted values for your UPS can be determined by
executing:</p><pre class="programlisting">
apcaccess eeprom

</pre><p>The line of interest for you is the <span class="bold"><b>Shutdown grace delay</b></span>, which can be changed
using the <a href="manual.html#SLEEP">SLEEP</a> directive in your <span class="bold"><b>apcupsd.conf</b></span> file. The default value is 20
seconds, but generally, you can set it to 180, 300, or 600 seconds
depending on your UPS. See the <a href="manual.html#eeprom" title="Configuring Your EEPROM">EEPROM</a> this
manual for further details on how to change this EPROM value.</p><p>If you use the <tt class="option">--kill-on-powerfail</tt> option, you
run the risk of having the computer power cut before the system has
shutdown. Even if the grace period is rather long, if something goes
wrong in the shutdown, well, it is up to you to decide.</p><p>If <i class="application">apcupsd</i> has successfully shutdown
your computer and powered off the UPS during a power outage, you can
control whether or not your computer is automatically rebooted when
the power returns.</p><p>The UPS contains two internal EPROM values that determine when
it will restore power to your computer after a full power shutdown.
They are the <a href="manual.html#RETURNCHARGE">RETURNCHARGE</a>
percentage and the <a href="manual.html#WAKEUP">WAKEUP</a>
delay. Briefly, the <span class="bold"><b>RETURNCHARGE</b></span>
specifies what percentage charge the battery must have before the
power is restored. Higher values are recommended in regions where the
power goes up and down frequently. The <span class="bold"><b>WAKEUP</b></span> delay is a simple time delay. Most sites
will have both of these at zero, or perhaps the <span class="bold"><b>RETURNCHARGE</b></span> set to 15. Please follow the links
to the <span class="bold"><b>Configuration</b></span> section of this
manual for more information.  See the <a href="manual.html#eeprom" title="Configuring Your EEPROM">EEPROM</a> of
this manual for further details on how to change these EPROM
values.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2915983"></a>Shutdown Problems</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Obviously if your halt script is not properly modified,
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> will not be able to shut off the
power to the UPS, and if the power returns before the batteries are
exhausted your system will not automatically reboot. In any case, your
machine should have been cleanly shut down. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2916004"></a>Master/Slave Shutdown</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>In master/slave configurations, however, the master cannot be
100 percent sure that the slaves have all shutdown before it performs
the power off. As a consequence, it is possible that the master will
shut off the power before the slave has finished shutdown. If this is
the case, the best procedure is to put an appropriate sleep command in
the <tt class="filename">/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</tt> file on the master.
For example to give the slaves 30 additional seconds to shutdown, one
would add:</p><pre class="programlisting">
sleep 30
</pre><p>just after the line that reads</p><pre class="programlisting">
doshutdown)
</pre><p>in the <tt class="filename">apccontrol</tt> file (approximately line
79 — depending on your system version).</p><p>Also, on a slave machine, you do not want to use the modified
halt script since it will recall <i class="application">apcupsd</i>,
which will detect that it is a slave (i.e. no connection to the UPS)
and will complain that it cannot do the killpower. This situation is
not harmful just annoying and possibly confusing.</p><p>One possible problem during shutdown can be caused by remnants
of old versions. Please be sure to delete or rename all prior versions
(<tt class="filename">/usr/local/sbin/apcupsd</tt> or
<tt class="filename">/sbin/powersc</tt>).</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2915486"></a>Startup</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Normally, <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is automatically
started when your system is rebooted. This normally occurs because the
startup script <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is linked into the
appropriate places in <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d</tt>. On most Linux
systems, there is a program called
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">chkconfig</span>(8)</span>
that will automatically link the startup script.  This program is
invoked by the <b class="command">make install</b> scripts, or it is
explicitly done for those systems that do not have
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">chkconfig</span>(8)</span>. If
this is not the case, you can either link it in appropriately yourself
or explicitly call it from your rc.local file. The appropriate manual
way to startup <i class="application">apcupsd</i> is by
executing:</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;path&gt;/apcupsd start
</pre><p>where &lt;path&gt; is normally <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d</tt> or
<tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d</tt> depending on your system (isn't
Unix wonderful? :-)). Using this script is important so that any files
remaining around after a power failure are removed. Likewise, shutting
down <i class="application">apcupsd</i> should be done with the same
script: </p><pre class="programlisting">

with additions from Andre H. Hendrick beginning in 1995, and we want
to give credit for good, hard work, where credit is due. After having
said that, you will see that Steven Freed built much of the orginal
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> information file. [Comment inserted
by Riccardo Facchetti]</p><p>The start of this chapter of the
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> manual in HTML format was pulled
from the <a href="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/apcsmart.html" target="_top">Network UPS
Tools (NUT)</a> site. It has been an invaluable tool in improving
<i class="application">apcupsd</i>, and I consider it the <span class="bold"><b>Bible</b></span> of APC UPS programming. In the course of
using it, I have added information gleaned from
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> and information graciously supplied
by APC. Hopefully, the additions made herein can benefit the original
author and his <a href="http://www.exploits.org/nut" target="_top">programming
project</a>, and maybe some day, the
<i class="application">apcupsd</i> project and the <span class="bold"><b>NUT</b></span> project can join forces.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2917097"></a>Description</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Here's the information on the elusive APC smart signaling protocol
used by their higher end units (Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS,
Matrix-UPS, etc). What you see here has been collected from a
variety of sources. Some people analyzed the chatter between
PowerChute and their hardware. Others sent various characters to
the UPS and figured out what the results meant.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2917115"></a>RS-232 differences</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Normal 9 pin serial connections have TxD on 3 and RxD on 2. APC's
smart serial ports put TxD on pin 1 and RxD on pin 2. This means
you go nowhere if you use a normal straight through serial cable.
In fact, you might even power down the load if you plug one of
those cables in. This is due to the odd routing of pins - DTR and
RTS from the PC usually wind up driving the on/off line. So, when
you open the port, they go high and *poof* your computer dies.</p><p>Originally this evil hack was used to connect the UPS to the PC
when this page was first being built. As you can see, I cheated and
neglected the ground (only 2 wires!) and it still worked. This
method can be used for playing around, but for professional systems
this is obviously not a viable option.</p><p>That hack didn't work out so well (damned cats), so it was
retired quite awhile back. The most practical solution was to go
out and BUY the DOS/Win version of PowerChute just for the black
(smart) cable. I recommend doing the same thing if you actually
care about this thing working properly. Of course, if you have one
of the newer packages that came with PowerChute, you already have
the cable you need.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2917156"></a>Diagram for cable hackers</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>If you are handy with cable creation tools, check out the <a href="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/940-0024C.jpg" target="_top">940-0024C
clone diagram</a>. That's the black &quot;smart&quot; cable
normally provided with APC models sold after 1996. The loopback pins
on that diagram are used to keep PowerChute happy by allowing cable
detection. If you use the <a href="http://www.exploits.org/nut/" target="_top">NUT</a> apcsmart driver, those
pins don't matter.</p><p>Many thanks to Steve Draper for providing this scan.</p><p>For additional information on cables, see the section on <a href="manual.html#cables" title="Chapter&#xA0;21.&#xA0;Cables">custom cables</a> in this manual.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2917212"></a>The Smart Protocol</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Despite the lack of official information from APC, this table has
been constructed. It's standard RS-232 serial communications at
2400 bps/8N1. Don't rush the UPS while transmitting or it may stop
talking to you. This isn't a problem with the normal single
character queries, but it really does matter for multi-char things

everything will work a lot better.</p><p>The following table describes the single character <span class="bold"><b>Code</b></span> or command that you can send to the UPS,
its meaning, and what sort of response the UPS will
provide. Typically, the response shown below is followed by a newline

command that it does not recognize or that is not available on your
UPS, it will normally respond by &quot;NA&quot; for not available,

        Enterprise Linux 3.0 (wb3).  The package build is
        controlled by a define set at the beginning of the file.
        These defines basically just control the dependancy
        information that gets coded into the finished rpm
        package.  So while you could technically build a package
        without defining a platform, or with an incorrect
        platform, and have it install and run it would not
        contain correct dependancy information for the rpm
        database.  The platform define may be edited in the spec
        file directly (by default all defines are set to 0 or
        &quot;not set&quot;).  For example, to build the RedHat 7.x package
        find the line in the spec file which reads
        </p><pre class="programlisting">    %define rh7 0</pre><p>and edit it to read </p><pre class="programlisting">    %define rh7 1</pre><p>Alternately you may pass the define on the
        command line when calling rpmbuild:
         </p><pre class="programlisting">
    rpmbuild -ba --define &quot;build_rh7 1&quot; apcupsd.spec                  
    rpmbuild --rebuild --define build_rh7 1&quot; apcupsd-x.x.x-x.src.rpm</pre></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><b>How do I control whether usb support gets built?</b></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        By default standard serial port support will be built and the
        apcupsd-std package will be produced. To get the usb package and support either
        set the </p><pre class="programlisting">    %define usb 0</pre><p> to 
        </p><pre class="programlisting">    %define usb 1</pre><p>
        in the spec file directly or pass it to rpmbuild on the command line:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">    rpmbuild -ba --define &quot;build_rh7 1&quot; --define &quot;build_usb 1&quot; apcupsd.spec</pre><p>
        </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><b>other defines are used?</b></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        The only other define is for the initdir for the daemon control script.
        On RedHat systems this is set to /etc/rc.d/init.d/.  You would only need to edit this
        if packaging for a platform with uses a different directory.
       </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="bold"><b>I'm getting errors about not having permission when I try
        to build the packages. Do I need to be root?</b></span></span></dt><dd><p>
        No, you do not need to be root and, in fact, it is better practice to build rpm packages
        as a non-root user. Bacula packages are designed to be built by a regular user but you must
        make a few changes on your system to do this. If you are building on your own system then
        the simplest method is to add write permissions for all to the build directory
        (/usr/src/redhat/). To accomplish this execute the following command as root:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">    chmod -R 777 /usr/src/redhat</pre><p> 
        If you are working on a shared system where you can not use the method above then you need to
        recreate the /usr/src/redhat directory tree with all of it's subdirectories inside your home
        directory. Then create a file named </p><pre class="programlisting">    .rpmmacros</pre><p> in your home directory (or edit
        the file if it already exists) and add the following line:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">    %_topdir /home/myuser/redhat</pre><p>
