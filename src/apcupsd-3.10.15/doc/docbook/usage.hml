<para>This is the manual for <application>apcupsd</application>, a
daemon for communicating with UPSes (Uninterruptible Power Supplies)
made by American Power Corporation (APC).  If you have an APC-made

document.</para>

<para>This manual is divided into parts which increase in technical
depth as they go.  If you have just bought a state-of-the-art smart
UPS with a USB or Ethernet interface, and you are running a current
version of Red Hat or SUSE Linux (8.0 or later), then
<application>apcupsd</application> is very nearly plug-and-play and
you will have to read only the <link linkend='basics'>Basic User's
Guide</link>. </para>

<para>If your operating system is older, or if you have an
old-fashioned serial-line UPS, you'll have to read about <link
linkend='legacy'>serial installation</link>.  If you need
more details about administration for unusual situations (such as a
master/slave or multi-UPS setup) you'll need to read the section on
<link linkend='advanced'>advanced topics</link>.  Finally, there
is a <link linkend='arcana'>Technical Reference</link>
section which gives full details on things like configuration 
file directives and event-logging formats.</para>

<para>You should begin by reading the <link linkend='quickstart'>Quick
Start</link> instructions.</para>
