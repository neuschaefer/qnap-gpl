<h1>Bug Reporting</h1>
<p>
Before reporting a bug, you should probably check
the Source Forge tracking lists described below to
see if the bug is already reported and if a patch exists.
<p>
To report a buf, send an email to the 
<a href="mailto:apcupsd-users at lists.sourceforge.net">
apcupsd-users at lists.sourceforge.net</a> email list.
The previous address was modified to prevent easy use by spammers. To use it,
you must replace the <b>at</b> with an @ symbol. 
<p>I (Kern) get a number of &quot;off-list&quot; emails sent
directly to me. Please always copy the appropriate list, if you
do not copy the list, I may not answer you, or I will answer by copying
the list. If you <em>really</em> have something confidential,
please clearly indicate it.
<p>

<h2>Information Needed</h2>
For us to respond to a bug report, we normally need the following
as the minimum information:
<ul>
<li>Your operating system</li>
<li>The model and UPS cable you are using</li>
<li>The version of apcupsd you are using</li>
<li>A clear description of the problem</li>
</ul>
The first three of these items can be fulfilled by sending
us a copy of your <b>config.out</b> file, which is in the
main <b>apcupsd</b> source directory after you have done
your <b>./configure</b>.
<p>In addition, we will sometimes need a copy of your apcupsd
configuration file. If you
think it is a configuration problem, please don't hesitate
to send it preferably as an attachment.
