<h1>Email Lists</h1>
<b>apcupsd</b> has two email lists which are described below with
links to subscribe, unsubscribe, or modify your account. You must
be subscribed to send email to these lists.

<h2>apcupsd-announce</h2>
The <b>apcupsd-announce</b> list is a low volume list for those
users who wish to be notified when there are important events
(important bugs, new releases, ...).  We recommend that all
users subscribe to this list. Do so by following the instructions at
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/apcupsd-announce">
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/apcupsd-announce</a>.
The same link can be used to modify your preferences or unsubscribe
as long as you have your password.
 
      
<p>It is also possible to get email notification whenever a new package
is released on SourceForge. This is accomplished by going to
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/apcupsd">Apcupsd SourceForge
Project</a> page and clicking on the little letter or mail icon 
<img src="mail16d.png"> under the heading <b>Monitor</b> in the
row corresponding to the package you want to monitor.

<h2>apcupsd-users</h2> 
The <b>apcupsd-users</b> list is the general forum to ask questions
about Apcupsd or respond to questions from other users.  The volume on
this list is generally light, but can vary.  All users are encouraged
to subscribe and to participate.  Due to spam attacks, anyone
wishing to send a message to this list, must be subscribed, which
you can do by following the instructions at
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/apcupsd-users">
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/apcupsd-users</a>
The same link can be used to modify your preferences or unsubscribe
as long as you have your password.
