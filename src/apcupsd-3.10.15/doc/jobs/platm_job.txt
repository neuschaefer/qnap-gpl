Purpose:
This document is intended to set out a basic set
of job functions and responsibilities in the Apcupsd

General:
The Apcupsd project is a collaborative effort involving
developers, porters, testers, and users. Each contributes
to making apcupsd a better product. Where ever possible,
decisions should be taken by informing the development
mailing list and arriving at a consensus. However, as in
all projects, there will be times when one person must 
make a decision. This document attempts to define 
the decisions to be made by the above named person.
