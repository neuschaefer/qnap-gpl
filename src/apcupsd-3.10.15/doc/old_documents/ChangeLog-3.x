        Applied kern diffs, see techlogs/kes26Jan00
        po/POTFILES file is now removed by main Makefile since is always built.
        Corrected Slackware distribution Makefile.in: it was tied to
        /usr/src. Thanks to John McSwain.
        Corrected a bug in configure.in and include/apc_defines.h in which

        the code without being able to test).

----> apcupsd-3.7.0-beta3 released.
        Bumped version to beta3 and released.
        Applied kern diffs, see techlogs/kes09Jan00
        Changed clean_threads() in apcexec.c not hang on waitpid, and make
        sure we do all we can to kill the childs.
        Updated INSTALL file to make clear that prior to install a new version
        of apcupsd over an old version, is advisable to make uninstall.
        Corrected a syntax error in distributions/*/apccontrol.sh.in.
        Changed suse halt.local script to:
         . do something only if a powerdown is detected.

        Changed the install to warn the user that if an old apcupsd.conf is in
        place, it is saved to apcupsd.conf.old.
        Applied Kern diffs, see techlogs/kes18Dec99.
        Reorganized the path construction in include/apc_defines.h so that now
        file paths are built with autoconf variables and not hardcoded.
        Applied Carl Erhorn patches for Solaris, see techlogs/cpe16Dec99.
        Now SuSE 5.2 is correctly detected (don't know previous versions).
        Cleanups of configure.in.
        Corrected a problem with SuSE and halt scripts where killpower where
        not issued correctly.
        Applied Helmut Messerer corrections.
        Applied Kern diffs, see techlogs/kes09Dec99

        New user contribution for sending sms messages on UPS troubles.

----> apcupsd-3.7.0-beta1 released.
        Applied Kern diffs, see techlogs/kes30Nov99
        Applied Kern diffs, see techlogs/kes28Nov99
        Applied Kern diffs, see techlogs/kes20Nov99

        More internationalization.
        Applied Kern diffs, see techlogs/kes13Nov99
        Moved TIOCM_LE HP-UX define and friends to include/apc_config.h
        Internationalization: internationalized and translated in Italian all the
        messages that are printed with printf and fprintf: more need to be done
        for error_* functions.
        Removed #ifdef wrapping around debug code and substituted with debug_level
        checks.
        Cleaned a remaining spit of `killpower' in apcupsd.c
        Help screen output to stdout.
        Now (C) and Brian's Support Center are visible in help screen output.
        Updates to the cgi files from Kern.
        Added a vimrc for TABs.
        --debug argument changed meaning. Now is meant to be set to a number that
        range from 0 to N where increasing numbers means increasing debug output.
        Now we use getopt_long [see getopt(3)] for parsing command line.
        Documentation updates and reorganization: now `developers' documentation
        is in doc/developers/.
        Added support for cable 940-0095B.
        Applied Kern patches: syslog, getline, code cleanups, new cgi
        interface. Read his technical log in techlogs/kes03Nov99
        Added doc/CodingStyle file.
        Added Developers file.
        Some minor code documentation.
        Removed the "failed to reacquire the lockfile" problem. Now we release
        the lockfile just before fork() and reacquire it just after.
        More duplicated code cleanups and nasty bugs fixed in apcaction.c.
        SuSE's apcupsd start script now return green "done" and red "failed"
        (SuSE 6.2)
        apccontrol is installed in /etc/apcupsd/ because we need it when
        filesystems may be umounted.
        Removed powersc script: now it is all done in apccontrol and
        /etc/rc.d/apcupsd scripts.
        Moved _all_ the scripts into scripts/ directory (where they belong).
        apccontrol script installation dir is now sysconfdir
        ${prefix}/etc/apcupsd
        Simplified apcaction.c (removed duplicate code).
        Attempt to document some features of apcupsd.conf.
        Deleted two alarm()s related to apcreports.c from apcaction.c: this
        was a bug.
        Added setproctitle for setting forked procs's argv[0]. Now we have
        apcmain -> waiting for other tasks to exit, generic watchdog.
        apcser -> serial task
        apcact -> actions task
        apcnet -> network task
        apcslv -> netslave task
        so that now we can tell with a `ps' which task is doing what.
        apcserial+apcreports are now one single thread.
        Better locking scheme.
        Removed another nasty bug in Old* variables into apcaction.c. Now
        there is a local structure for these values.
        Removed a nasty bug in apcsetup.c.
        Updated man pages and apcupsd.conf.
        RedHat installation scripts.
        Removed 10 seconds sleep() from terminate().
        SHM ID for sanity checks on SHM accesses.
        Obsolete config options now generate only warnings.
        New error handling routines.
        doc/README.developers updated.
        Syslogging functions are bracketed with HAVE_GCC so that with gcc we
        can use macros and with other compilers we use functions for
        compatibility.
        Syslog functions are now real functions. There's no point in having
        incompatible preprocessor macros when a set of little functions can do
        the job.
        Fixed a next_slave label in apcnet.c with a semicolon for HPUX
        compiler.
        OS detection in configure: now Makefiles and sources know about which
        OS they are supposed to compile for.
        Better integration of lib/ sources into the configure mechanism.
        configure cleanups.
        Added cflags and ldflags selection in Makefile.in and configure.
        Fixed getopt_long detection in configure. Now if not found it compile
        the lib/ version.
        Now configure.in have a hardcoded PATH in which search the system
        programs needed.
        Lot of cleanups in global variables and code partitioning and
        duplication.
        More configure cleanups.
        Updated RH 6.0 halt script.
        Removed apchttp.
        Cleaned THREADS. Now forked processes are the only option.
        Various cleanups.
        SuSE-specific install/uninstall.
        All distribution specific directories are now in distributions/.
        All scripts are now in scripts/.
        Moved default apcupsd.conf in etc/.
        Added distribution-specific scripts installation.
        Install /etc/apcupsd.conf if not alredy present.
        Removed apc(un)install.sh: no more needed.
        Rewritten external scripts: no more system(), better customization
        support.
        Removed Makefile.in.in from po/: it's not needed.
        Fixed bogus --enable and --disable behavior of configure.
        Cleaned up po/ and intl/ autoconf.
        Only powerflute is linked with ncurses libraries.
        The program makedepend is not any more vital for compilation.

----> apcupsd-3.6.2
        Fixed the "apcupsd -c" configure command.
        Fixed two thread bugs in alarm handling.
        Fixed two potential security exploits.
        More cleaned up autoconf.
        Random documentation cleanups.

----> apcupsd-3.6.1
        Cleaned up new autoconf stuff from version 3.6.0
        Undefined a test flag for testing networks wierdness.
                #undef WACKY_NETWORK_ATTEMPS
        Network is fully functional under non-threaded compile.
        Possible fix for "pipe_master_status" calls on slaves.
        Added 940-1524C smart signal cable support.

----> apcupsd-3.6.0
        Added autoconf.
        Added internationalization support. There is _only_ the support but
        no current code is written for the intl package. It can be compiled
        in, but intl strings have still to be translated (to be done in the
        future).
        Reorganized documentation.
        Reorganized support for distributions. Now we have a directory for
        every possible distribution (suse, unifix, debian etc etc) so that the
        job for the package-men can be easier.

----> apcupsd-3.5.9
        Added new configuration options to reduce init time of daemon.
        powersc CONFIG
        powersc NAME
        powersc BATTERY

----> apcupsd-3.5.8.patch

        Fixes a FIFO error that I forgot to include in the rush
        to release the code

----> apcupsd-3.5.8

        GPL2 source code status finally...........April 7, 1999

        Threaded code is stable but requires glibc2 or libc6
        Finished SELFTEST setup
        Fixed naming of UPS if allowed.
        Redesigned "apcsetup.c" to allow for ease of parameter setup.

----> apcupsd-3.5.7

        Added 940-0024G cable.
        "newbackupspro" to be replaced by "backupspropnp"

        If you have a BackUPS Pro UPS that is identified as
        BP(SIZE)(EXTRAS) examples BP420SC/BP650SC/BP650PRO-PnP,
        then you have a PnP BackUPS Pro that is very near a SmartUPS.
        Else anything with the identifier BK(SIZE)PRO or BKPRO(SIZE)
        is the very early version of the "dumbed down smartups".
        Unfortunately, it has very little to say.  It is superior to the
        classic BackUPS (simple signals) in that it can at least tell event
        histories and if the batteries are faulted. 

        now powerflute is compiling and working, needs THREADS

----> apcupsd-3.5.6

        See Makefile for enabling flags.

        # New multi-threading code BETA
        #
        # THREADS   = 1

        # New multi-threading code with http BETA functional needs THREADS
        #
        # HTTP      = 1

        # New/Old powerflute tool
        #
        # MUSIC     = 1

        dual building model possible complete.
        intergrated beta http data
        breakages in logs and procfs are still present in shm.
        code sorting and corrections.
        return of ncurses powerflute tool.
        fixed Makefile to find two possible locations of
        ncurses package; however, there are three methods for this animal.

        apcconfig.c: removed check for existance of lock directory. It's not
        needed and dangerous when -killpower !
        apcconfig.c: new configuration checks
        added semun definition to apc_struct.h since it is needed for glibc6

----> apcupsd-3.5.5

        dual building model begun.
        intergrated beta shared memory mapping.
        breakages in logs and procfs are present.

----> apcupsd-3.5.4

        Preparation for GPL status and transfer to GNU.
        Fixed Network bug.
        Fixed IPC PIPE bug.

----> apcupsd-3.5.3

        Fixed UPS killpower bug.

----> apcupsd-3.5.2

        Source wide reformat to conform to standard C programing format

----> apcupsd-3.5.1


----> apcupsd-3.5.0

        fixes "NO" reports in setup loops for UPSes that do not allow for
        changing parameters at initialization.  Previously it was assumed that
        UPSes did not report anything if the feature was not pollable and/or
        changeble.

----> apcupsd-3.4.9

        fixes a long missed error that was incorrectly fixed in the past.

Network death solved (hopefully)
PowerFlute removed due to unexplainable daemon kills under 2.0.X. and
some cases of 2.1.X. (TCPIP)

This is replaced bye the original tool that now works "apcaccess".
"apcaccess" is functional under both 2.0.X and 2.1.X kernels without
killing the damon "apcupsd".

EPROM programming of many UPS models is now functional.

Listing my hack of "powerflute".  To enable it edit your /etc/apcupsd.conf
and set NETTIME to any value <60> seconds is something to play around.

Reformat subroutines to get apcupsd to handle networks.

----> apcupsd-2.9.4 70707 Oct 25 13:51 apcupsd.c

Smart V/S is in the same class as a BackUPS Pro.

Riccardo Facchetti <riccardo@master.oasi.gpa.it> has been volunteered to solve the
network part for the project. YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hello Andre,
I own a SmartUPS v/s and I have played a bit with your apcupsd. I have
found that the SmartUPS v/s command set is similar (if not equal) to the
one of BackUPS PRO, so I have changed the apcupsd.c code to behave this
way and seems to work well.

Another thing: I would like to have an application like powerchute. Of
course I am willing to write it, so I will call it powerflute.

My idea is:

apcupsd -> daemon
        - controls power status
        - listen on a TCP socket for incoming connections
                - get a command from TCP line
                - send the response to the command

powerflute -> application
        - connect to apcupsd
                - sends a command to apcupsd
                - get the response from apcupsd

apcupsd is listening to the socket with a select so it don't block. After
one or more connections are established, it read non-blocking from the TCP
file descriptor(s) and when a char is available, send it to UPS and
readline(), then send the buffer (terminated with '\n' to the TCP client
over the connection file descriptor.

You can note that I have protected apcupsd UPS monitoring from TCP
servicing by doing only non-blocking calls to the TCP layer, so there
should be no problem for it in detecting power problems without delay
caused by TCP connections.

A patch is enclosed for v/s == BKpro and for TCP servicing.
Of course this patch is still very preliminar, but I think it is a good
idea.

You can try the idea running the apcupsd with this patch applied,
telnetting to the port 6669 from localhost (no external connections
allowed now for security) and sending to the daemon some commands for the
UPS. The daemon will redirect them to the UPS and send the answer to you.
You can connect more than one client to the daemon (max 64 connections).

Please send me comments about it.

Ciao,
        Riccardo.

Fixed @222  Soft shutdown and suspend for SmartUPS Only.
            by Werner Panocha, wpanocha@t-online.de
            UPS will go back in 22 hours and 12 minutes!!
            This is a suspend command, and every digit
            counts for 1/10 hour (6 minutes)

Started Debian project

----> <----

Added support for 940-0023A cable.
USE only as a last resort.
There is no way to kill the UPS, nor detect battery status.

TRANSLATION:

YOU CAN BREAK YOUR SYSTEM IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR UPS's BATTERY.
ALSO, IF YOUR TIMEOUT IS TO LONG.

Please use another cable if possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"After building and installing the daemon & init files I found
out why you #define the term _ANNOY_ME...it is rather annoying
to get 'wall'ed every 3 seconds - though I do think the
feature is important.  I made a trivial modification to a few
files to make the time delay ('wall' frequency) configurable
at build time.  If you haven't made this change yourself, feel
free to incorporate these changes into your development source
if you think it would be useful to others."

Name change to help sunsite.unc.edu "keeper" daemon.

Black Cables #940-0024B and #940-0024C are now supported for APC SmartUPS.
They have been tested on an APC SmartUPS SU700/1400RM.  I don't know if
it will work on APC BackUPS Pro Series.......
Tested SmartUPS SU700RM with SMNP PowerNet(tm) card and SmartMode i/o
through DB-9 port with 940-0024B and #940-0024C.  This means that you
can SMNP manage your SmartUPS with SMNP PowerNet(tm) card.  You must have
your own SMNP software..........
Added /proc/apcupsd file for pseudo procfs info.
Deleted announce aka -D_ANNOY_ME, for pseudo procfs info file.

Borrowed a bunch of code for Smart-UPS from Pavel Korensky's apcd.c & apcd.h.

bug found by Tom Kunicki <kunicki@surgery.wisc.edu>
"I still can cause the UPS to shutoff with a power disturbance by
 typing 'apc_upsd /dev/apc_ups killpower' before the disturbance." ... "
 Maybe you could disable the 'killpower' switch except for when the UPS

I have tested my BackUPS cable on the following and it works as designed:
  APC BackUPS 400, APC BackUPS 600, and APC SmartUPS SU1400RM.
I have tested APC's cable #940-0020B on the following and it works as designed:
  APC BackUPS 400, APC BackUPS 600, and APC SmartUPS SU1400RM.
I have NOT tested a BackUPS Pro, since I don't have one yet.

NOTE: My SmartUPS CABLE has broken code and more likely a broken cable design.

Black Cables #940-0024B and #940-0024C are still in the works but not high
priority, yet.

----> Enhanced_APC_UPS v1.8 Apr  8 00:06 apc_upsd.c

-D_SMARTUPS can no longer be define if you select USE_APC=yes
There is no SmartUPS "Smart Mode" support, it has never been available.
I am waiting to hear from APC about pinouts for the following cables
#940-0023A their Unix OS cable and
#940-0095A their Win95OS cable.
If you want to use and APC cable, you must have cable #940-0020B ONLY....

----> Enhanced_APC_BackUPS v1.0 Sep 20 01:52 backupsd.c

Known Bug in special power situations.  IFF (if and only if) the following
happens will this daemon fail to do its job.

If your power fails long enough to cause "backupsd" to activate and cleanly
shutdown your Linux-Box, and returns later only breifly.

( That is long enough for the UPS to clear the KILL_POWER_BIT and causes )
( your Linux-Box to reboot.  But not long enough to recharge you UPS's   )
( battery above the low-battery latch state, and power fails again.  The )
( daemon cannot currently catch the status change.                       )

I have never had this happen to me ever, but I can force this to happen
under laboratory test conditions.  You can too, but it is not advised.
Your filesystem will say "!@#$%#$*&#$@" and much more to you.

Thanks for the support and use of this daemon.
