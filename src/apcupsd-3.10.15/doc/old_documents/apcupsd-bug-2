Subject: [APCUPSD-BUG] Is 3.5.2 beta?!

Operating System: linuxrh - Other:

Subject: Is 3.5.2 beta?!

Problem:
Hi there,

I know this is free software so I should be happy its there and not complain.
I am kind of frustrated with trying to get apcupsd 3.5.2 to work on my Redhat 5.2 
system and since you asked for bug reports, I´m going to tell you what I think 
anyway.

1) What is the sense of requiring the /etc/apcupsd.conf file with to start with
    ´## apcupsd 3.5.1 ##´ when I am using 3.5.2? Why doesn´t apcupsd not
   complain though when there is NO config file at all?

2) I got a APC Smart-UPS 700. When I have set ´ACCESS true´, which I haven´t
    found any documentation on, apcupsd doesn´t do anything when there is a
    power failure. Took me a while to figure that one out.

3) I´ve set ´TIMEOUT 300´ with BATTERYLEVEL and MINUTES commented out.
    Thought that would give me 5 minutes before the machine is shut down 
    after I switch off power - but it always goes down right after 30 seconds.

4) It never comes up again after power is back :-(.

Thanks for reading this, even better if you could drop me a line..

Sven
