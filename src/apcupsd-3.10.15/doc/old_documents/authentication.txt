Authentication design
  RF

The password file is in the apcupsd config directory
and is called apcpasswd.conf
This file is plain text in the form:

username:password:level

The level can be one of the two: slave, admin
Slave is for daemon slaves that want to connect to a master
for remote monitoring the power line. Their access is limited
to the functions a slave is allowed to perform: send notifications
to master and change the poll time.
Admin is for human interface clients that want to gain full access
to the UPS programming.

The basic level of information gathering is password-free as the
info distribution can be limited by other means (network security)
and in a local network anyone should be able to know which is the
status of the UPS powering the computer in use.

The human interface for admin level will require to input username
and password by hands. No automation is provided.

The slave logon for slave level don't require any user intervention
as automation is provided. The slave will have in its configuration
file (apcupsd.conf) a way to specify the slave username and password.

E.g. for a slave with this line in apcpasswd.conf file:

azuth:pippo:slave

the slave's config file apcupsd.conf file will be like:

...
upsstart azuth
   device upsname@127.0.0.1:7777
   login username password
upsend

and everything should be in place for slave operation.
