<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Apcupsd Linux UPS daemon version 3.8.3 
</H3>
<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>apcupsd a program for controlling APC UPSes</H1>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<P><B>/sbin/apcupsd</B> <BR><B>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</B>
<BR><B>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</B> <BR><B>/sbin/apcaccess</B>
<BR><B>/sbin/apcnisd</B> 
</P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P><B>Apcupsd </B>can be used for controlling APC UPSes.
During a power failure, <B>apcupsd</B> will inform the users about
the power failure and that a shutdown may occur. If power is not
restored, a system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted,
a timeout (seconds) expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC
calculations determined by power consumption rates. If the power is
restored before one of the above shutdown conditions is met, <B>apcupsd</B>
will inform users about this fact. 
</P>
<p><b>Apcupsd</b> runs on Linux systems, many Unix systems (Solaris,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Alpha, ...) as well as on Windows systems
(Win95/98/Me/NT/2000).</p>
<P><B>Apcupsd</B> performs the shutdown by calling
<B>/etc/apcupsd/apccontrol</B>, which is a shell script.
Consequently, no changes to /etc/inittab are necessary. There is no
communication between <B>apcupsd</B> and init(1) process. During
installation, the system halt script was modified so that at the end
of the shutdown process during a power failure, <B>apcupsd</B> will
be re-executed in order to power off the UPS. This step is not
mandatory, but is good practice as it avoids the possibility of your
system being prematurely restarted if the power returns for a short
period. It also permits your computer to be automatically rebooted
when the power is restored providing you have configured your computer
BIOS appropriately.
</P>
<P>The <B>apcupsd</B> daemon now supports two networking modes that
function independently, but if desired at the same time. 
</P>
<P>Most users will probably enable the first network mode, which
permits <B>apcupsd</B> to serve <A HREF="status.html">STATUS</A> and
<A HREF="events.html">EVENTS</A> information to clients over the
network. 
</P>
<P>The second networking mode is for multiple networked machines that
are powered by the same UPS. In this mode, one machine is configured
as a master with the UPS attached to the serial port. The other
machines (maximum 20) powered by the same UPS are configured as
slaves. The master has a network connection with the slaves and sends
them information about the UPS status. Please see the <A HREF="configure.html#UPS_Sharing">UPS
Sharing section</A> of this document for more details.</P>

<P>RedHat and SuSE. versions of Linux have direct install support, as does
Solaris.
All other flavors of Linux and Unix machines
may need some fussing with to get the
install correct.
