<h1>Batteries</h1>
<h2>Battery Problems</h2>
If you have your UPS long enough, you will probably have battery
problems. Below, you will find some suggestions for replacing batteries.
One IMPORTANT note of caution: at least one user purchased one of the
non-APC batteries noted below and found out that they would not
fit into his unit. This required cutting and soldering and other
very undesirable things, so be extremely careful in measuring
the batteries including every millimeter of the terminal connections
which can cause problems.
<p>
Although you can do a hot swap of your batteries while the
computer is running (it works, I tried it), it may not be very
satisfactory because the unit will not know that the batteries
have been swapped and apcupsd will continue to show Low Battery.
To correct this situation, you must do a discharge and recharge
of the battery. At that point the battery should be calibrated better.
As noted below, Carl has found that it takes several discharge/charges
before the runtime calibration is accurate.  Take care not to discharge
your battery too much as it tends to shorten the battery life.

<h2>What Various People Have to Say about Batteries</h2>

<p>Here is what John Walker has to say about APC UPS batteries:
<p>
<blockquote>
I thought I'd pass on some information I've obtained which you'll probably eventually need.  
Besides, by writing it down I'll be able to find it the next time.
<p></p>
I started installing mine in 1995-1996.  Lead-acid batteries have a finite life even if 
not subjected to deep discharge cycles.  For the batteries used by APC, this is typically 
four to six years.  As part of the self-test cycle, the UPS measures the voltage of the 
battery at full charge (which falls as the battery ages), and if it's below about 90% 
of the value for a new battery, it sets off the &quot;Replace battery&quot; alarm, which it 
repeats every day. [on apcupsd versions prior to 3.8.0, this message is
sent once, on version 3.8.0, it is sent every 9 hours - KES].
<p></p>
You will occasionally get a false alarm.  It's a good idea if you get an alarm to 
repeat the self-test the next day and see if the alarm goes away.  
If the alarm is persistent, you need to replace the batteries, which can be 
done without powering down the UPS or load-you just open up the battery door, 
take out the old batteries, and hook up the new ones.
<p>
APC makes &quot;Replacement Battery Units&quot; for each of the SmartUPS models, but 
they sell them directly only in the U.S.  
<p>
It's best to wait until the low battery alarm before ordering a replacement-keeping 
batteries on the shelf reduces their life unless you keep them fully charged.
</blockquote>
And Andr&eacute; Hendrick says:
<blockquote>
[For replacement batteries] You need to goto you your local Yamaha SeaDoo shop.
There are 35 AMP Hour deep cycle marine batteries that are direct replacements. 
These are gel-cel and will double the runtime and/or cut your recharge time in half.

Finally, here is what Carl Erhorn has to say about batteries:

<blockquote>
Hi, Folks.
<p> 
Well, Kern was absolutely right. The problem with my UPS was
batteries. It was unexpected though, because there was no
indication of a bad battery right up until the UPS failed
entirely.
<p> 
For those who might encounter the same thing, and don't know
what's happening (I didn't either), here's what happened.
<p> 
A week or so ago, I turned on one of my SmartUPS 700-NET
models. The load is a small dual P-III unix server (Solaris 8,
X86) and a 4MM tape drive. During the normal selftest that
runs when you first turn on any APC UPS, the UPS 'freaked
out'. The alarm stuttered at about 4 or 5 beeps per second,
and all the panel lights flashed spasmodically, as if something
was loose inside the UPS.
<p> 
I turned off the UPS and it's load, then turned the UPS on
again. This time, everything seemed fine. I booted the system
that was attached, and there were no problems. The status
monitor showed 9 minutes runtime (which indicates fairly low
capacity), but the batteries showed fully charged. I began to
suspect a bad inverter in the UPS.
<p> 
However, Kern told me that he suspected the batteries. So I
took the UPS offline, put an old SU-600 in it's place (just
barely big enough to handle the startup peaks - I get an
'overload' lamp lit for about 2 seconds during boot), and
checked out the batteries. They did indicate that they were
near the end of life, so I ordered a replacement set. Those
came in on Friday, and after the initial charge, a complete
charge/discharge cycle to recalibrate the UPS, and some
testing, I put it back in service.
<p> 
Surprise! (Or maybe not?) Kern was right - there is nothing wrong
with the inverter or the charging circuit, and the new cells
fixed everything.
<p> 
What confused me is that there was no 'replace battery'
indication from the UPS, even when it failed, plus a fair amount
of runtime indicated with a full charge. So if you see such
behavior on one of your UPS models, it makes sense to replace
the batteries, even if there is no indication that the batteries
have failed yet.
<p>
One of the things I learned during this process is that the UPS
internal calibration will lose accuracy over the life of the
battery. I always do a recalibrate when I install new cells, but
rarely do it after that, as it's time-consuming, and you really
can't use the system attached to the UPS while doing it. Since
my systems are almost constantly in use, it's a pain to schedule
a recal, and I tend to put it off. This time it bit me. I'd
suggest that folks do a recal at least once every six months. It
will make your runtime estimates much more accurate, and also
allows you to keep track of the state of your batteries.
<p>
For those who don't know how to do this, here's what you do. This
proceedure should not be confused with the 'Recalibrate' feature
in the APC PowerchutePlus software. They do not do the same thing.
<p>
>From APC's web site:<br>
*****<br>
Perform a Runtime Calibration. This is a manual procedure and
should not be confused with the runtime calibration performed
through PowerChute plus. The batteries inside of the Smart-UPS
are controlled by a microprocessor within the UPS. Sometimes it
is necessary to reset this microprocessor, especially after the
installation of new batteries. Stop the PowerChute plus software
from running and disconnect the serial cable. There must be at
least a 30% load attached to the UPS during this procedure, but
the process will cause the UPS to shut off and cut power to its
outlets. Therefore, attach a non-critical load to the UPS and
then force the UPS on battery by disconnecting it from utility
power. Allow the unit to run on battery until it turns off
completely. Make sure a 30% load is present! Plug the UPS back
into the wall outlet and allow it to recharge (it will recharge
more quickly turned off and with no load present). Once the unit
has recharged, the "runtime remaining" calculation should be
more accurate. Remember that if the unit is an older model, then
the runtime will not improve significantly.
<p>
Background:<br>
An APC Smart-UPS has a microprocessor which calculates runtime
primarily based on the load attached to the UPS and on its
battery capacity. On the right side of the front display panel
there is a vertical graph of five LEDs. Each LED is an indication
of battery charge in increments of twenty percent: 20, 40, 60, 80,
100% (bottom to top). For example, if the battery charge is 99%,
then only four of the five LEDs are illuminated.
<p> 
To ensure that an operating system receives a graceful shutdown
when using PowerChute plus or a SmartSlot accessory, an alert is
generated by the Smart-UPS indicating that the UPS has reached a
low battery condition. The alert is audible (rapid beeping),
visual (flashing battery LED or LEDs), and readable through the
graphical interface of PowerChute plus software (or a native UPS
shutdown program within a particular operating system.) In order
to calculate this "low battery condition," all Smart-UPS products
have a preconfigured low battery signal warning time of two
minutes (this is the factory default setting). There are a total
of four user-changeable settings: 2, 5, 7, or 10 minutes. If the
low battery signal warning time is set for 2 minutes, then the
alerts will activate simultaneously two minutes prior to shutdown.
Similarly, if the total runtime for a particular UPS is 30
minutes with a low battery signal warning time set at 10 minutes,
then the UPS will run on battery for 20 minutes before the low
battery alert begins.
<p> 
Total runtime is primarily based on two factors, battery capacity
and UPS load. UPS load and runtime on battery are inversely
proportional: as load increases, battery runtime decreases and
vice versa. When utility power is lost, the UPS begins discharging
the battery in order to support the attached load. Once power
returns, the Smart-UPS will automatically begin to recharge its
battery.<br>
****<br>

<p> 
My comments on this proceedure:<br>
I believe this proceedure works for all APC models that calulate
runtime, not just the SmartUPS. It's important that you load the
UPS to 30% of the UPS capacity, as reported by apcupsd or another
UPS monitor program. I've found that normal house lamps of
different wattages allow me to adjust the load to almost exactly
what I want, which is between 30% and 35% of the UPS capacity.
This is critical te getting an accurate reading (according to the
APC web documents). Always bring the UPS to 100% charge first, as
indicated by the front panel lamps, or your UPS monitoring
software.
<p> 
Set the UPS shutdown time to 2 minutes, all other settings to
nominal, and disconnect the serial port cable from the UPS before
running the recalibration. If you leave a monitoring program
running through the serial port, it will turn the UPS off early,
and you don't want to do that during a recalibration run. When the
run is complete, and the UPS turns off, you can reattach the
serial cable, and the normal loads, and recharge the batteries
normally. If you think you might have a power outage during the
recharge time, allow the UPS to recharge to 20% or so (indicated
by the panel lamps) before trying to use the computer system. This
will allow the UPS to handle short dropouts while it recharges. Of
course, if you can leave the computer off during the recharge
time, the UPS will recharge much faster.
<p> 
As an aside, when the batteries failed, my total runtime at 100%
charge and an idle state was 9 minutes, which is pretty bad. I
replaced the batteries with extended capacity cells, which add
about 15% to the stock capacity. Now, after two complete charge/
discharge cycles, 100% charge shows the available runtime to be
42 minutes on the system when it's idle, and 33 minutes when the
system is very busy. The differences are due to the load of the
computer, when the disks are busy, and the cpus are not in a
halted state (my system halts the cpus when they are idle, to
save power and lower heat, as do other OS like Linux), when
compared to an idle state. Apcupsd indicates the load is about
27% when idle, and as much as 37% when heavily loaded.
<p> 
I've found that two charge/discharge cycles result in a more
accurate recalibration when installing new cells. It appears
that some batteries need to be put through a couple of complete
cycles before they reach their full capacity. I've also noticed
that the full-charge voltage is different for each battery until
they have been through two cycles. On the initial charge of my
new batteries, the 100% charge voltage on the two cells was
almost .5 VDC apart. After two complete cycles, the batteries
measure within .01 VDC of each other!
<p> 
I hope this information helps anyone who might encounter the
problem I saw, and also shows folks how to recal their batteries.
If you haven't done a complete recalibration in a year or two,
I'd recommend it, so that you have warning of a low battery
instead of what happened to me.
<p>

<h2>Where Carl Suggests to get Batteries</h2>
<blockquote>

Hi, Folks.
<p>
I'm just replacing the batteries in one of my SmartUPS models,
and it occurs to me that some of you may not know about the
place I get them from. I have no relationship with this company,
other than as a customer, but I feel they know what they are
doing, their prices are fair, and they have some interesting
batteries available that you can't obtain from APC.
<p>
These are the reasons I use them, and I thought this information
might be useful to the US list members. They 
will ship outside of the US. If you have questions, you can
contact them through the email address listed on their web pages.
They have always responded pretty quickly to my questions.
<p>
The company is called Battery Wholesale Distributors, and they
are located in Georgetown, Texas. If you have questions, you can
reach them by phone at (800) 365-8444, 9:00AM to 5:00PM (their
local time), Monday through Friday. I've gotten email from them
on the weekends, although the office is not open then.
<p>
I won't post prices, as you can get current pricing from their
web site. They have an entire section dedicated to APC replacement
batteries, and it's easy to find what you need. You can order over
the web, or by phone. They accept all the usual credit cards.
<p>
The web site (as you might guess) is:
<a href=http://www.batterywholesale.com>www.batterywholesale.com</a>
<p>
The thing I really like is that they have found manufacturers who
make batteries in the standard case sizes, but have additional
capacity over the original batteries shipped with the APC UPS
models. Often, the difference is as much as 15% or so, and this
can result in additional runtime. It's a nice upgrade for a minor
increase in price.
<p>
They are also 'green-aware', in that they encourage you to recycle
your old batteries, and will accept the old batteries back from
you if you cannot find a local place that recycles them. You pay
the shipping, but I think other than that, there is no charge.
I've never done this, as I have a battery retailer just down the
street who will accept my old batteries.
<p>
Anyway, if you didn't know about these folks, put the info aside
where you can find it when you need replacement batteries. I
won't make any guarantees, but I've been very pleased with their
products, service, and pricing. I hope you find them as helpful
to you as I do. I've been dealing with them since about 1994, and
have never been disappointed. The owner of the place also is very
good on technical issues, so if you have questions on their
products, he can get as technical as you need to go.
<p>
Regards,<br>
--Carl
