<H1>Configuration Examples</H1>
<h2>A Simple Configuration for a SmartUPS</h2>
You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC.
A very simple configuration file would look like the following:
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ##
UPSCABLE smart
UPSTYPE smartups
DEVICE /dev/ttyS0
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</pre>
<p>Normally you would have many more configuration directives
to completely customize your installation, but this example
shows you the minimum required.</p>
<h2>A Simple USB Configuration</h2>
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ##
UPSCABLE usb
UPSTYPE usb
DEVICE /dev/usb/hid/hiddev[0-15]
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</pre>

<h2>A Simple Master Configuration</h2>
You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC and
you want it to act as a master for another computer, which
is powered by the same UPS.
A very simple configuration file would look like the following:
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE smart
UPSTYPE smartups
DEVICE /dev/ttyS0
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS netmaster
UPSMODE net
NETTIME 10
NETPORT 6666
SLAVE slave1.mynetwork.com
SLAVE slave2.mynetwork.com
</pre>
<p>Note, the main difference from the stand alone configuration is
that you have specified <b>UPSCLASS netmaster</b> and <b>UPSMODE net</b>.
In addition, you have specified one or more slave machines. </p>
<h2>A Simple Slave Configuration</h2>
You have a Smart UPS using the cable supplied by APC that
is connected to the master machine configured above. This
slave machine has no serial port connection to the UPS, but
is powered by the same UPS as the master.
A very simple configuration file would look like the following:
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE ether
UPSTYPE smartups
LOCKFILE /var/lock
UPSCLASS netslave
UPSMODE net
NETPORT 6666
MASTER master.mynetwork.com
</pre>
<p>The main difference from the master configuration is that you
have specified <b>UPSCABLE ether</b> and <b>UPSCLASS netslave</b>. 
In addition, you have specified a single controlling master.</p>
In this configuration, the shutdown will be initiated by the
master. It is also possible to specify BATTERYLEVEL, MINUTES,
and TIMEOUT configuration directives in the Slave machine that
will cause the slave to shutdown before the master. This can
often be useful if the slave is less important than the master
and you wish to reduce battery power consumption so that the
master can remain up longer during a power outage.

<h2>Variation on the Master/Slave Configuration</h2>
It is also possible to have a Master/Slave configuration where
the Slave is powered by a different UPS (or any other power 
source), but is nevertheless controlled (i.e. shutdown) by
the master. The setup would be identical to the Master/Slave
configuration files shown above. The only difference is where
the slave actually receives its power. In effect, <b>apcupsd</b>
does not know or care where the power really comes from.

<h2>A Sample Slave Configuration Using the Net Driver</h2>
As opposed to the master/slave mode demonstrate above, you
can turn any computer into a slave by configuring with the
NIS network driver turned on <b>--enable-net</b>.  Running 
in this configuration, you can use any computer with <b>apcupsd</b>
running the Network Information Server (NIS) as the master. The
slave simply uses the NIS information to decide when to shutdown.
This is a much simpler mode than the older master/slave code
mentioned above.
<pre>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ## 
UPSCABLE ether
UPSTYPE net
LOCKFILE /var/lock
DEVICE server-network-address:3551
UPSCLASS standalone
UPSMODE disable
</pre>
where  on the <b>DEVICE</b> directive
you replace the <b>server-network-address</b> with the 
fully qualified domain name or IP address of a machine running
<b>apcupsd</b> with NIS enabled (and normally, but not required,
connected to a UPS).  The :3551 that follows the server address is
the port to use. The default is 3551, but older versions of apcupsd
used port 7000.  
<p>
Please do not confuse this with a master/slave network configuration
that is described above. This is a master/slave setup, but much 
simpler (the master does not know about the slaves), and any
NIS server, even a slave, can act as a server to a slave that
listens to it.
<p>This mode works principally by reading the STATFLAG record
that is sent by the NIS (present in the output of apcaccess).
The low 16 bits are the standard APC status flag, and the 
upper 16 bits represent the internal state of apcupsd, so the
slave can see when the power fails and know when to shutdown.
