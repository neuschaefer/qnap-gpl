<H1>Apcupsd Post Installation Configuration</H1>
<p>It may be necessary to change the configuration information in the
file <b>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf</b> to meet your needs and to
correspond to your configuration. This file is a plain ASCII file and
you can use your favorite editor to change it. However, please
take a careful look at the <a href="install.html">installation chapter</a>
in this document, because many of these directives can be correctly
set during installation using the <b>./configure</b> program. This simplifies the
task of editing the configuration file, and ensures that other
files (CGI) are appropriately modified as well.</p>

<h2>Three Major Configuration Possibilities for Apcuspd</h2>
There are three major ways of running <b>apcupsd</b> on your
system. The first is a standalone configuration where <b>apcupsd</b>
controls a single UPS, which powers the computer. This is the most
common configuration. The second configuration is a master/slave
configuration, where one UPS powers several computers, each of which
runs a copy of <b>apcupsd</b>. The computer that controls the UPS
is called the master, and the other computers are called slaves.
The master copy of <b>apcupsd</b> communicates with and controls
the slaves via an ethernet connection.
The third configuration (new with version 3.8.3), is where a single
computer controls multiple UPSes. In this case, there are
several copies of <b>apcupsd</b> on the same computer 
each controlling a different UPS. One copy of <b>apcupsd</b> will
run in standalone mode, and the other copy or copies will normally
run in master/slave mode.
<p>These three possibilities can be represented by the following
diagrams:</p>

<h2>Configuration Directives</h2>

<H3><a name="ConfigGeneral"></a>General Configuration Directives</H3>
In general, each of these directives is required (the DEVICE directive
is ignored for UPSCABLE ether).

<dl>
  <dt STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><a name="UPSTYPE"></a>
      UPSTYPE&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;type of APC UPS you have&gt; </dt><dd> One
      of the big problems is understanding what kind of UPS you have and
      knowing what cable to use with what UPS. If you received a cable
      with your UPS, the cable number is stamped on the side of the
      connector (usually in the plastic on both cable ends), and it is
      most likely the correct cable for your UPS. <p>In the table below,
      we attempt to show what cables are known to work with each UPS.
      This information is a bit sketchy and so should not yet be
      considered definitive.  Any comments or corrections would be
      appreciated.</p> The UPSTYPE directive can be defined during
      installation by using the <b>--with-upstype=</b> option on the
      <b>./configure</b> program.<p></p>

        Note, in version 3.10.x and later, the &quot;real&quot; values for

        <b>dumb</b>, <b>apcsmart</b>, <b>net</b>, <b>usb</b>, <b>snmp</b>,
        and <b>test</b>. These names can be directly specified on the 
        <b>UPSTYPE</b> directive. In fact, any of the names provided above
        such as <b>backups</b>, <b>smartups</b> ... can also be specified
        on the <b>UPSTYPE</b> directive, but they will always be translated
        into one of the basic driver names.  At some point in the future,
        we will drop all these model names in favor of the simpler driver
        names.

        <p>If you have a Smart or a SubSmart UPS (see table above), and you
        build your own cable, build a <b>Smart-Custom</b> cable (see the
        <a href="cables.html">Cables Chapter</a>  of this manual).  If you
        have a <b>Simple</b> UPS, build a <b>Simple-Custom</b> cable.
        If you have a BackUPS CS with a RJ45 connector, you can build your own
        <b>Custom-RJ45</b> cable.
       <p>
        The <b>--with-upscable=</b> option can be used on the <p>./configure</p> program
        to set this directive during the installation.
        </dd>

    
  <dt><a name="DEVICE"></a>DEVICE&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;name of device&gt;  </dt>   
    <dd> Please specify which device is used for UPS
      communications (normally a serial port or a USB port.
      The default is platform dependent, and is usually
      something like /dev/ttyS0.  For USB ports, you may
      specify a port range specification of the form
      <b>/dev/usb/hid/hiddev[-0-9]</b>.  Normally, the
      ./configure program will set an appropriate default
      value, otherwise, you may also specify the
      <b>--with-serial-dev=</b> option on the
      <b>./configure</b> program to set this directive during
       the installation.
      <p>If you have specified <b>UPSTYPE net</b>, then the device name
      to be specified consists of <b>hostname:port</b> where the hostname
      is the fully qualified name or IP address of the host (NIS server) 
      and the port (optional) is the port to use to contact the server.
      <p>If you specified <b>UPSTYPE snmp</b>, then the device name
      becomes <b>hostname:vendor:community</b>. Please the 
      <a href="snmp.html">Support for SNMP UPSes</a> chapter in this
      manual for more details.

   </dd>
                
  <dt><a name="LOCKFILE"></a> LOCKFILE &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;path to lockfile&gt; </dt>
         <dd STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
     By supplying this argument, &quot;apcupsd&quot; tries to create a
     lockfile for the serial port in the specified directory. This
     is important to keep two programs from reading or writing the serial
     port at the same time. Please note that although the directive name
     is LOCKFILE, you are actually specifying the lock file path. Apcupsd automatically
     appends the name of the device when creating the file. On most systems, this 
     directive is automatically set by the <b>./configure</b> program. You may
     also explicitly set it during the installation process by using the
     <b>--with-lock-dir=</b> option on the <b>./configure</b> program.
        </dd></dl>
                
<H3><A NAME="ConfigInfoServer"></A>Configuration Directives Used by the Network Information Server</H3>
None of these directives are required for proper operation of <b>apcupsd</b>.
For the Network Information Server to work, it must be enabled in the
configuration (default) with <b>--enable-nis</b>.
<a name="NETSERVER"></a><dl>
  <dt>NETSERVER [on | off] 
        </dt><dd>
        This configuration directive turns the network information
        server on or off.  If it is on, <b>apcupsd</b> will spawn a
        child process that serves STATUS and EVENTS information over the
        network.  This information is currently used by the Web based
        CGI programs.  The default is on.  In some cases, for added
        security, you may want to invoke a separate information server
        daemon from the inetd daemon.  In that case, <b>NETSERVER</b>
        should be <b>off</b>.  </dd>
  <dt>NISIP &lt;IP-address&gt;</dt><dd>
        This directive specifies an
        IP address on which NIS server will listen for incoming connections.
        Default value is 0.0.0.0 that means any incoming request will be
        serviced but if you want it to listen to a single subnet you can
        set it up to that subnet address, for example 192.168.10.0
        Additionally you can listen for a single IP like 192.168.10.1.
        You may also use the <b>--with-nisip=</b> option on the
        <b>./configure</b> program to set this directive during
        the configuration phase. 
        <p>
        This directive does not work on Win32 machines because
        inet_ipton() is not implemented there. </dd>

  <dt><a name="NISPORT"></a>
        NISPORT &lt;port&gt; 
        </dt><dd>
        This configuration directive specifies the port to be used by the
        <b>apcupsd</b> Network Information Server.  The default is
        platform dependent, but typically 3551, which we have received
        from IANA as the official <b>apcupsd</b> networking port.  If
        you change this port, you must manually change the #define
        SERV_TCP_PORT in cgi/upsfetch.c and rebuild the CGI programs.
        An alternative is to use the <b>--with-nis-port=</b> option on
        the <b>./configure</b> program during installation.  In this
        case, all the appropriate locations will be automatically
        changed.  </dd>
  <dt><a name="EVENTSFILE"></a>
        EVENTSFILE &lt;filename&gt; 
        </dt><dd STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
        If you want the <b>apcupsd</b> network information server to
        provide the last 10 events via the network, you must specify a
        file where <b>apcupsd</b> will save these events.  The default
        is: <b>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</b>.  Currently,
        <b>apcupsd</b> will save at most the last 50 events.
        Periodically (once an hour by default), <b>apcupsd</b> will
        check the size of this file.  When more than 50 events are
        recorded, <b>apcupsd</b> will truncate the file to the most
        recent 10 events.  Consequently this file will not grow
        indefinitely.  Although we do not recommend it, you may change
        these values by editing apcevents.c and changing the appropriate
        defines.  Be aware that if you set these values to very large
        numbers, <b>apcupsd</b> may make excessive memory demands on the
        system during the data access and file truncation operations.  <
        p>This filename may also be specified at installation time by
        using
         the <b>--with-log-dir=</b> option on the <b>./configure</b> program.</p>
         </dd>
</dl>

<H3><a name="ConfigPowerFail"></a>Configuration Directives used during Power Failures</H3>
In general, none of these directives are required. However, if you have a simple 
signaling (dumb) UPS with a cable that does not support the Low Battery signal,
you must set the TIMEOUT directive to force a shutdown. Please see the
<a href="cables.html#CableModes">Simple Signaling features Supported</a> section of
this manual for more details.
<a name="ANNOY"></a>
<dl> 
  <dt>ANNOY &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;time in seconds&gt; </dt><dd>
     Specify the time in seconds between messages requesting
     logged in users to get off the system during a power failure.
     This timer starts only when the UPS is running on batteries.
     The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).  <b>apcupsd</b> sends
     the annoy messages by invoking the <b>apccontrol</b> script
     with the <b>annoyme</b> argument.  The default is to send a
     <b>wall</b> message on Unix systems and a <b>popup</b> in
     Windows.  The value of <b>ANNOYDELAY</b> must be greater than
     the value of <b>ANNOY</b> in order to receive annoy messages
     (this doesn't make sense, and means that the default values
     do not generate annoy messages -- KES).<br> Note that if
     <b>NOLOGON</b> is set to <b>disable</b> the annoy messages
     will also be disabled.
     </dd>
  <dt><a name="ANNOYDELAY"></a>
     ANNOYDELAY&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;time in seconds&gt; 
        </dt><dd>
      Specify delay time in seconds before <b>apcupsd</b> begins
      requesting logged in users to get off the system during a
      power failure.  This timer starts only after the UPS is
      running on batteries.  This timer is reset when the power
      returns.  The default is 60 seconds.  Thus, the first warning
      to log off the system occurs after 60 seconds on batteries,
      assuming that <b>NOLOGON</b> is not set to <b>disable</b>.
        </dd>
  <dt><a name="NOLOGON"></a>NOLOGON&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;specifies when
           <b>apcupsd</b> should prevent user logins&gt;
        </dt>
    <dd STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
      [ disable | timeout | percent | minutes | always ] are valid types. 
        </dd><dd>
      The type specified allows you
      define the point when <b>apcupsd</b> will create the
      <b>/etc/nologin</b> file and thus when user logins are
      prohibited.  Once the <b>/etc/nologin</b> file is created,
      normal users are prevented from logging in.  Control of when
      this file is created is important for allowing systems with
      BIG UPSes to run as normally until the system administrator
      determines the need for preventing user logins.  The feature

    incorrect value for remaining runtime when the battery is fully
    charged. This can be checked by examining the <b>TIMELEFT</b> value 
    as printed in the output of an  <b>apcaccess status</b> command.

<a name="UPS_Sharing"></a>
<H3>Configuration Directives for Sharing a UPS</H3>
The following directives apply to the master/slave networking mode of
<b>apcupsd</b> where multiple machines can be powered by the same UPS.
One machine, the master, will have a serial port connection to the UPS, and
the other machines, the slaves, will obtain their information via the network
from the master.
<p>
Note, as of version 3.10.x, the old master/slave code is by default turned off
in the configuration. You must explicitly enable it by including a 
<b>--enable-master-slave</b> option on your <b>./configure</b> command 
before building the source.
<p>
In addition to the old master/slave code, there is now a new network driver
enabled with <b>--enable-net</b> (default disabled) that can be used to
control a slave from any version of apcupsd running NIS. This is a much
more flexible system of controlling slaves because a slave machine that
also has NIS turned on can thus act as a master for another slave with
<b>--enable-net</b> turned on. With this mode turned on, the slave
obtains the address of the master from the <b>DEVICE</b> directive,
which takes the form <b>hostname[:port]</b> as a consequence, none of
the directives apply for this form of networking.  In addition, for this
mode to work, you must specify <b>UPSTYPE net</b> so that the proper
driver is loaded.
<p>
The remainder of this section presents directives that apply
to the old master/slave code that must be enabled by
the <b>enable-master-slave</b> configuration option.
