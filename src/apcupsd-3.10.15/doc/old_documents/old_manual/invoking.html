<H2>Invoking Apcupsd</H2>
<P>The simplest way to invoke <B>apcupsd</B> is from the command line
by entering:</P>
<P class=tty>/sbin/apcupsd</P>
<P>To do so, you must be root. However, normally, you will want
<B>apcupsd</B> started automatically when your system boots. On some
systems with installation support (e.g. S.u.S.E and RedHat), the
installation procedure will create a script file that you will be
automatically invoked when your system reboots. On other systems, you
will have to invoke <B>apcupsd</B> from your <B>rc.local </B>script.</P>
<H3>Invoking Apcupsd on RedHat systems</H3>
<P>On RedHat systems, this script file that automatically invokes
<B>apcupsd</B> on system start and stops is: 
</P>
<P class=tty>/etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd</P>
<P>To start <B>apcupsd</B> manually (as you will probably do
immediately following the installation), enter the following: 
</P>
<P class=tty>/etc/rc.d/init.d/apcupsd start</P>
To understand how this file is automatically invoked at system
startup and shutdown, see the man pages for <b>chkconfig</b>.
<H3>Invoking Apcupsd on SuSE systems</H3>
<P>On SuSE systems, the script file that automatically invokes
<B>apcupsd</B> on system start and stops is: 
</P>
<P class=tty>/etc/rc.d/apcupsd</P>
<P>To start <B>apcupsd</B> manually (as you will probably do
immediately following the installation), enter the following: 
</P>
<P class=tty>/etc/rc.d/apcupsd start</P>
