<h2>New Features in Apcupsd 3.8.3</h2>

<p>
&middot; Highlights of this release:
</P>
<PRE>
. The ./configure program prints a warning message if /usr/ucb is
  on your path. This for Solaris systems where the wrong shutdown
  program could be used.
. Corrected serial port lock file location on Solaris.
. Added an optional port specification to the hosts.conf file
  for configuring multimon.cgi
. Added the --disable-install-distdir configure option to allow
  clean installation of two or more apcupsds on the same system.
</PRE><P>

</P>
<P>The software is completely developed
under Linux and will compile cleanly and will work under Linux
as well as many other operating systems and flavors of Linux.

----> Release apcupsd-3.8.3 (26 Nov 2001)
      - Updated manual to include ideas/suggestions received
        from users installing 3.8.2.
      - Fixed safe.apccontrol to be a bit more system independent 
        (thanks to Steven Orr for the idea).
      - Added safe.apccontrol.in so that it is configured properly.
      - Fixed all apccontrol.sh.in so that it restart the computer if shutdown
        was cancelled. Fixed also the lock directory location in rc scripts.
      - Removed infinite sleep from shutdown sequences.
      - Added a big warning message to the end of the ./configure
        output if /usr/ucb is on your path (for Solaris shutdown).
      - Updated Solaris configuration with specific config values.
      - Fixed reference to lock file in Solaris apcupsd.in so it is
        properly configured.
      - Removed unused variable from Solaris apcupsd.in
      - Install apcupsd.conf with 644 permissions
      - Add --disable-install-distdir ./configure option.
        This allows easier installation of slaves or
        multiple copies of apcupsd.
      - Used makedepend if not gcc (Solaris fix).
      - Set SO_REUSEADDR in slave machines.
      - Use select() to timeout master if slave does not respond.
      - Recognize APC Smart-UPS 370ci.
      - Add 940-0020C cable support (same as 20B).
      - UPSNAME now sets upsname if given. Otherwise, apcupsd
        attempts to get name from UPS, if not found, uses
        hostname, finally "default".
      - Implement CommLost NIS status.
      - Implement Shutdown NIS status.
      - Implement Slave NIS status.
      - Correct SmartTrim and SmartBoost detection code.
      - ./configure prints name of shutdown program.
      - Add port to hosts.conf.
      - Add new apccontrol arguments to script file.
      - Eliminated all N/A fields in STATUS report.
      - Always construct STATFLAG in STATUS report.
      - Added Ambient Temperature and Humidity to multimon (Carl Erhorn)
