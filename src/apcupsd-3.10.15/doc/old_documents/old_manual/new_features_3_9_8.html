<h2>New Features in Apcupsd 3.9.8</h2>
<pre>
----> Release apcupsd-3.9.8 (27 January 2002)
    - New drivers layer adds new keywords to the UPSTYPE configuration
      variable (dumb, apcsmart, usb, snmp, net, and test). NOTE! only the
      first three are currently functional. All the old UPSTYPE keywords
      are translated into dumb or apcsmart for backward compatibility.   
      NOTE! snmp, net, and test drivers are experimental and thus
      largely non-functional.
    - Reorganized developers documentation inside an html manual
      (Riccardo).
    - Support SCO OpenServer.
    - Includes all enhancements to the officially released versions through
      3.8.5.
    - Make drivers block a reasonable amount of
      time (maximum 1 minute, minimum 1 second). Blocking is determined
      by the state and functions requested.
    - Many enhancements to the USB driver to support SmartUPSes (mostly).
    - New code by Kamal to handle and truncate the events file.
    - New smtp program to permit email messages from WinNT/Win2000 machines.
    - Updates to apcaccess.
    - New Dmsg() debug message code implemented.
    - Include apctest Runtime Calibration feature.


----> Release apcupsd-3.9.4 Aug 13 2001
    - Improvements in master/slave timeout detection and error messages.
    - New master connect/disconnect events (accontrol).
    - Additional master/slave documentation.
    - Document USB.
    - Updated manual to include ideas/suggestions received
      from users installing 3.8.2.
    - Fixed safe.apccontrol to be a bit more system independent
      (thanks to Steven Orr for the idea).
    - Added safe.apccontrol.in so that it is configured properly.
    - Added a big warning message to the end of the ./configure
      output if /usr/ucb is on your path.
    - Fixed reference to lock file in Solaris apcupsd.in so it is
      properly configured.
    - Removed unused variable from Solaris apcupsd.in
    - Added Makefile to examples directory
    - Modified main Makefile.in to do clean and distclean of examples
    - Additional documentation.
    - Removed the sleep 2d from the halt script.
    - Install apcupsd.conf with 644 permissions
    - Add --disable-install-distdir ./configure option.
      This allows easier installation of slaves or
      multiple copies of apcupsd.
    - Used makedepend if not gcc (Solaris fix).
    - Set SO_REUSEADDR in slave machines.
    - Add 940-0020C cable support (same as 20B).
    - UPSNAME now sets upsname if given. Otherwise,
      apcupsd attempts to get name from UPS, if not found,
      uses hostname, finally "default".
    - Implement CommLost NIS status.
    - Implement Shutdown NIS status.
    - Implement Slave NIS status.
    - Correct SmartTrim and SmartBoost detection code.
    - ./configure prints name of shutdown program.
    - Add port to hosts.conf.
    - Add new apccontrol arguments to script file.
    - Add UPSNAME to RedHat apccontrol.
    - Manual updates.
    - Eliminated all N/A fields in STATUS report.
    - Always construct STATFLAG in STATUS report.
    - Added generic symlink installation in distributions/
    - Cleanups of main Makefile.in
