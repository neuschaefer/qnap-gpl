<h2>Quick Start for Beginners</h2>
For beginners, setting up <b>apcupsd</b> can be 
a bit overwhelming because of the new terminology
and the large number of options available in <b>apcupsd</b>.
As a consequence, the following is meant to 
help guide to the steps needed to get it up and 
running as painlessly as possible.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First take a look at the <a href="configure.html">Configuration Chapter
    </a> of the manual. In particular, look at the 
        <a href="configure.html#ConfigGeneral">models and cables
        supported</a>.</li>
<li>Decide if you have a Smart UPS, a Dumb UPS, or a USB UPS.</li>
<li>Find out what cable type you have by looking on the
    flat ends of the cable for a number such as 940-0020A
    stamped in the plastic.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="install.html">Building and Installing</a>
    section of the manual.</li>
<li>Configure, build, and install <b>apcupsd</b></li>
<li>Tweak your <b>/etc/apcupsd/apcupd.conf</b> file as necessary.</li>
<li>Read and follow the instructions in the
    <a href="testing.html">Testing</a> chapter of the manual.</li>
<li>If you run into problems, read the <a href="troubles.html">
    Trouble Shooting</a> section of the manual.</li>
<li>If you still need help, send a message to the
    developer's email list <apcupsd-devel at apcupsd.org> describing
    your problem, what version of <b>apcupsd</b> you are using,
    what Operating System you are using, and anything else that
    would be helpful.</li>
</ul>
