<h2>Apcupsd STATUS Logging</h2>
There is a good deal of information available about the
UPS and apcupsd's status. This document describes the format
of that information.

<h2>STATUS format</h2>
The STATUS output is in ASCII format with a single data value
or piece of information on each line output. Because not all
UPSes supply the same information, the output varies based on 
the type of UPS that you are using. In general, if the information
is not available for your UPS, the data portion of the output
record will contain an <b>N/A</b> indicating that the information
is not available.
<P>Status logging consists of periodically logging ALL available
information concerning the UPS. Since the volume of data is
rather large (over 1000 bytes per status), the STATUS data 
is not automatically sent to the system log file, 
instead, it is written as a series of data
records to a specific file (normally <b>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status</b>). 
</P>
<P>After each write, the file is rewound so that the size of the file
remains constant. At the current time, this file is 1135 bytes. The
format of this file is very similar to the old apcupsd procfs file.
The STATUS file is kept for backward compatibility and will be
eliminated in a future version of <b>apcupsd</b>. The preferred method
for obtaining this information is from <a href="apcaccess.html"><b>apcaccess status</b></a> or
by using the <b>apcupsd</b> <a href="cgiprogs.html">network information server</a>.

<H3>STATUS logging</H3>
</P>
<P>To make reading the status data reliable via a named pipe, the
first record written contains a version number, the number of records
that follow the first record, and the total number of bytes in those
subsequent records. An actual example of such a status file
(/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.status) is: 
</P>
<P>Consequently, the first record always consists of 24 bytes (23
characters followed by a newline). This record starts with APC and as
indicated in the example above is followed by 28 records consisting
of 675 bytes. The last record begins with END APC and contains the
date and time matching the DATE record. 
</P>
<P>Documentation of each record needs to be written. In the coming
weeks, I plan to add additional records and possibly change the names
of some of the fields. 
</P>
<P>When this data is written to a file, it is written as two records,
the first record, and all the other records together. In reading the
file, it can be either be read a record at a time, or in one big
read. 
</P>
<P>When this data is written to syslog(), it is written a record at a
time. The first record is the first 24 bytes. By having the number of
records and the size in the first record, the complete status can be
reliably reassembled.

<h2>Logging the STATUS Information</h2>
If specified in the configuration file, the STATUS data will also be written
to the system log file. Please note, that it would not normally be
wise to write this data to a normal system log file as there is no
mechanism in syslog() to rewind the file and hence the log file would
quickly become enormous. However, in two cases, it can be very useful
to use syslog() to write this information. 
</P>
<P>The first case is to setup your syslog.conf file so that the data
is written to a named pipe. In this case, normally not more than
about 8192 bytes of data will be kept before it is discarded by the
system. 
</P>
<P>The second case is to setup your syslog.conf file so that the
status data is sent to another machine, which presumably then writes
it to a named pipe. Consequently, with this mechanism, provides a
simple means of networking apcupsd STATUS information. 
<p>
Although we mention system logging of STATUS information, 
we strongly recommend that you use the <b>apcupsd</b> 
<a href="cgiprogs.html">network information server</a> to
network this information. Also, see the
<a href="logging.html">system logging</a> section
of this manual.
