<h2>Upgrading to Apcupsd 3.7.1</h2>
Quite a number of the configuration statements have changed
between versions 3.6.2 and 3.7.1, so you should either take
the new apcupsd.conf file and modify it, or update your existing
file. In general, we recommend starting with the new file.
<p>
If you have used a prior version of apcupsd, the CONTROL script file
(/sbin/powersc) has now been replaced by /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol.
Consequently, the CONTROL configuration statement is obsolete.
The following configuration statements have been replaced by scripts
called from /etc/apcupsd/apccontrol, and thus are obsolete:
BATTCMD, LIMITCMN, LOADCMD, PWRCMD, REBOOTCMD, REMOTECMD, RETCMD,
and TIMECMD.
<p>
On most systems the script that started and stopped <b>apcupsd</b>
was called <b>apcups</b>. In versions 3.7.0 and later, this script has been
renamed to <b>apcupsd</b>.
<p>
If you use the master/slave networking code, please be aware that
the <b>Apcupsd 3.7.1</b> network protocol is not compatible with
prior versions. Thus to use master/slave networking, you must
upgrade your master and all the slaves at the same time.
<p>
Since there are now a number of script files and data files used
by <b>apcupsd</b>, they have been moved from their previous locations
to the directory <b>/etc/apcupsd</b>. The executable files (<b>apcupsd</b>,
<b>apcaccess</b>, ...) remain in their prior locations (normally
<b>/usr/sbin</b> or <b>/sbin</b> depending on your configuration).
<p>
With this release, there are four <a href="cgiprogs.html">Web CGI programs</a> (<b>multimon.cgi</b>,
<b>upsstats.cgi</b>, <b>upsfstats.cgi</b>, and <b>upsimage.cgi</b>). To
have them properly installed, you must run the <b>./configure</b> command with
<b>--enable-cgi</b> and you must specify an installation directory with
<b>--with-cgi-bin=</b> or load them manually.
