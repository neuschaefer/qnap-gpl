<h1>Credits</h1>
The APC UPS protocol was originally analyzed by Pavel Korensky
with additions from Andre H. Hendrick beginning in 1995, and 
we want to give credit for good, hard work, where credit is due. After having
said that, you will see that Steven Freed built much of the
orginal <b>apcupsd</b> information file. [Comment inserted by Riccardo Facchetti]<p>
The start of this chapter of the <b>apcupsd</b> manual in HTML format was pulled from the 
<a href="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/apcsmart.html">Network UPS Tools (NUT)</a>
site. It has been an invaluable tool in improving <b>apcupsd</b>, and I
consider it the <b>Bible</b> of APC UPS programming. In the course of
using it, I have added information gleaned from <b>apcupsd</b> and information
graciously supplied by APC. Hopefully, the additions made herein can
benefit the original author and his 
<a href="http://www.exploits.org/nut">programming project</a>, and maybe
some day, the <b>Apcupsd</b> project and the <b>NUT</b> project can join
forces.
<H2>Description</H2>
Here's the information on the elusive APC smart signaling protocol used
by their higher end units (Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS, Matrix-UPS, etc).
What you see here has been collected from a variety of sources.  Some people
analyzed the chatter between PowerChute and their hardware.  Others sent
various characters to the UPS and figured out what the results meant.

<H2>RS-232 differences</H2>
Normal 9 pin serial connections have TxD on 3 and RxD on 2.  APC's smart
serial ports put TxD on pin 1 and RxD on pin 2.  This means you go nowhere
if you use a normal straight through serial cable.  In fact, you might even
power down the load if you plug one of those cables in.  This is due to 
the odd routing of pins - DTR and RTS from the PC usually wind up driving
the on/off line.  So, when you open the port, they go high and *poof* your
computer dies.
<P>
Originally this evil hack
was used to connect the UPS to the PC when this page was first being built.
As you can see, I cheated and neglected the ground (only 2 wires!) and 
it still worked.  This method can be used for playing around, but for
professional systems this is obviously not a viable option.
<P>
That hack didn't work out so well (damned cats), so it was retired quite
awhile back.  The most practical solution was to go out and BUY the 
DOS/Win version of PowerChute just for the black (smart) cable.  I recommend
doing the same thing if you actually care about this thing working properly.
Of course, if you have one of the newer packages that came with PowerChute,
you already have the cable you need. 

<h2>Diagram for cable hackers</h2>
If you are handy with cable creation tools, check out the
<A HREF="http://www.exploits.org/nut/library/940-0024C.jpg">940-0024C clone diagram</A>.  
That's the black &quot;smart&quot;
cable normally provided with APC models sold after 1996.  The loopback
pins on that diagram are used to keep PowerChute happy by allowing cable
detection.  If you use the <A HREF="http://www.exploits.org/nut/">NUT</A>
apcsmart driver, those pins don't matter.  
<P>
Many thanks to Steve Draper for providing this scan.

cables section</a> of this manual.

<H2>The Smart Protocol</H2>
Despite the lack of official information from APC, this table has been 
constructed.  It's standard RS-232 serial communications at 2400 bps/8N1.
Don't rush the UPS while transmitting or it may stop talking to you.
This isn't a problem with the normal single character queries, but it
really does matter for multi-char things like &quot;@000&quot;.  Sprinkle a
few calls to usleep() in your code and everything will work a lot better.

<P>
The following table describes the single character <b>Code</b> or command
that you can send to the UPS, its meaning, and what sort of response the
UPS will provide. Typically, the response shown below is followed by a 
newline (\n in C) and a carriage return (\r in C). If you send the
UPS a command that it does not recognize or that is not available 
on your UPS, it will normally respond by &quot;NA&quot; for not available, otherwise
the response is given in the &quot;Typical results&quot; column.

<h2>EEPROM Values</h2>
Upon sending a ^Z, your UPS will probably spit back approximately
254 characters something like the following
(truncated here for the example):
<P>
#uD43132135138129uM43229234239224uA43110112114108 ....
<P>
It looks bizarre and ugly, but is easily parsed.  The # is some kind of
marker/ident character.  Skip it.  The rest fits this form:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Command character - use this to select the value
<LI>Locale - use 'b' to find out what yours is (the last character), '4' applies to all
<LI>Number of choices - '4' means there are 4 possibilities coming up
<LI>Choice length - '3' means they are all 3 chars long
</UL>
Then it's followed by the choices, and it starts over.
<P>
Matrix-UPS models have ## between each grouping for some reason.
<p>Here is an example broken out to be more readable:
<p><pre>
   CMD DFO RSP FSZ FVL
   u   D   4   3   127 130 133 136

   CMD == UPSlink Command.
         u = upper transfer voltage
         l = lower transfer voltage
         e = return threshold
         o = output voltage
         s = sensitivity
         p = shutdown grace delay
         q = low battery warning
         k = alarm delay
         r = wakeup delay
         E = self test interval

   DFO == (4)-all-countries (D)omestic (I)nternational (A)sia (J)apan
          (M) North America - servers.
   RSP == Total number possible answers returned by a given CMD.
   FSZ == Max. number of field positions to be filled.
   FVL == Values that are returned and legal.

<h2>Programming the UPS EEPROM</h2>
There are at this time a maximum of 12 different values that can be
programmed into the UPS EEPROM. They are:
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=5 CELLPADDING=5>
<TR><TH align="center">Item<th align="center">Command<TH>Meaning</tr>
<tr><td>1.<td align="center">c<td>The UPS Id or name</tr>       
<tr><td>2.<td align="center">x<td>The last date the batteries were replaced</tr>
<tr><td>3.<td align="center">u<td>The Upper Transfer Voltage</tr>
<tr><td>4.<td align="center">l<td>The Lower Transfer Voltage</tr>
<tr><td>5.<td align="center">e<td>The Return Battery Charge Percentage</tr>
<tr><td>6.<td align="center">o<td>The Output Voltage when on Batteries</tr>
<tr><td>7.<td align="center">s<td>The Sensitivity to Line Quality</tr>
<tr><td>8.<td align="center">p<td>The Shutdown Grace Delay</tr>
<tr><td>9.<td align="center">q<td>The Low Battery Warning Delay</tr>
<tr><td>10.<td align="center">k<td>The Alarm Delay</tr>
<tr><td>11.<td align="center">r<td>The Wakeup Delay</tr>
<tr><td>12.<td align="center">E<td>The Automatic Self Test Interval</tr>
</table>
<p>
The first two cases (Ident and Batt date) are somewhat special 
in that you tell the UPS you want to change the value, then you
supply 8 characters that are saved in the EEPROM. The last ten
item are programmed by telling the UPS that you want it to cycle
to the next permitted value.
<p>In each case, you indicate to the UPS that you want to change
the EEPROM by first sending the appropriate query command (e.g.
"c" for the UPS ID or "u" for the Upper Transfer voltage. This command
is then immediately followed by the cycle EEPROM command or "-". In
the case of the UPS Id or the battery date, you follow the cycle 
command by the eight characters that you want to put in the EEPROM.
In the case of the other ten items, there is nothing more to enter.
<p>The UPS will respond by "OK" and approximately 5 seconds later by a
vertical bar (|) to indicate that the EEPROM was changed.
