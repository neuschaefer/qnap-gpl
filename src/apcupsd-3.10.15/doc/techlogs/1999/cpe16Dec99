        Technical notes on my code submission of 16 Dec 99
                        Carl Erhorn


General:

- I've added some source files to the sun directory, changed 
many others as a result of testing, and added a README.solaris 
file in the source directory. I added my name to a new port
entry in the Developers file, 'Solaris Port:'. 

- This is the first real attempt to provide a port of the 3.7.0
package to the Sun Solaris system. I am currently testing on a 
Solaris X86 system, running Solaris 2.6 with all recommended 
patches, and the Y2K recommended patches. The UPS is an APC 
SMartUPS-700, attached by a standard serial port. 

- I have moved the PID files into /etc/apcupsd, rather than using
/etc. It keeps all the related files except the lock file in one
place. 

- Many thanks to Kern and Riccardo, who helped me get the initial 
bugs out, provided a tremendous amount of information, and made
many changes for me as a result of my feedback. Kern in particular
has been instrumental in my getting going again with the porting 
process. 

Work to complete:

- I have not done careful testing of the network features, as I
do not have a second Solaris system here. However, I intend to 
test using a Redhat Linux system as a net client, and will be 
building the package on that system soon. 

Suggestions:

- I think that the killpower diagnostic messages should not be
displayed unless the daemon determines that it cannot get an
OK response from any of the methods that it tries. As long as
one method works, the diagnostic messages should be suppressed.
