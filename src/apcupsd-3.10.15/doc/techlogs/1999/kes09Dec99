         Technical notes on my code submission of 9 Dec 99
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- I added some more documentation and corrrected some
  of the previous stuff.
- Bug fix in upsimage.c, see below.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Kaspar Klingholz is having similar problems to those
  experienced on the Sun and HP. When he applied some
  of the partial fixes I sent to Carl, the program
  ran but did not register EVENTS.  Since Riccardo
  still was on vacation, I requested him to take
  the latest source from my Web site and report the
  results.
  He also reported a divide by zero problem in upsimage.c
  when the runtime goes to zero (you exhaust your batteries).
  I corrected it here.
- Added some new documentation and corrected some
  previous stuff.
- I've succeeded in building RPMs (source and binary),
  but will wait for awhile before making them available.
- I deleted apcnetd.man from the doc directory. It is
  out of date and not really needed given the new manual.
