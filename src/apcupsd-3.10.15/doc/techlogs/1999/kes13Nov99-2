         Technical notes on my second code submission of 13 Nov 99
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Fixes to make install work on RedHat 5.2

Changes submitted this submission:
- Fixed the cgi/Makefile.in to include the -lm
  option so that floor() is included on RH5.2
  Also the tabs were missing (my fault).
- Modified the apcupsd.in file in the RedHat
  distributions directory to detect whether or
  not it is running on RedHat 5.2. If so, it does
  not call the success or fail routines that were
  added in RedHat 6.0
- Use the correct directory for apccontrol
- Modified all the halt files to call apccontrol
  instead of /sbin/powersc
