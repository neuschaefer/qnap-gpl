         Technical notes on my code submission of 02 Aug 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Submission of code to make apcupsd compile under CYGWIN
  and run on Windows 98 and Windows NT (possibly Win95).

Changes submitted this submission:
- I removed the directory distributions/win32
- I added a new directory under the source directory named win32
  that contains all the Win32 code.
- I moved much of the configure code into a new autoconf directory
- I updated the configure.in code to integrate the Win32 builds 
  correctly. This required a few changes to the Makefile.in file 
  as well.
- Updated the HTML manual to have the beginnings of documentation
  of the Windows code. There is much to be done here.
