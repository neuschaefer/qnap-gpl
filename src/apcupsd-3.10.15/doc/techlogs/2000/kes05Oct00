         Technical notes on my code submission of 05 Oct 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Several bug fixes
- Fixed problems with Win32 binary release that
  prevented proper shutdown. Thanks to the testing
  efforts of Paul Stagner.
- More documentation for Win32. Add ChangeLog to
  manual, renumber to 3.8.0

Changes submitted this submission:
- Moved # comment characters in Makefiles to
  column 1 to avoid problems with native Alpha make.
- Fixed a problem in apcaction.c reported by Nikita Schmidt
  that caused early shutdown on power loss in some cases 
  if using a nonzero value of TIMEOUT. This was a bug that
  I introduced in 3.8.0 in optimizing the code.
- Fixed a problem with old SmartUPSes manufactured before 1994
  where certain EEPROM values are not available. This was causing
  immediate shutdown on power loss. This is an ancient bug.
- Enhanced the error print out if apcupsd is unable to execv()
  the apccontrol file. This is critical for proper shutdown and
  helps debugging failed shutdown testing.
- Fixed a problem where when the cursor is over the tray icon
  in the Win32 version that is being run as a slave. The correct
  status was not shown.
- Modified configure.in to add the -Wall option to the compile only
  if we are using a gcc compiler as this option does not normally exist
  on other compilers.
- Removed a C++ comment from multimon.c and replaced it with a 
  standard C comment.
- Increased the version from pre1 to pre3 (pre2 was used to release
  corrected Win32 binaries).
- At Riccardo's request fixed a script problem on SuSE as reported
  by Lothar Hegebart.
- Fixed a bug in configure.in when setting the default compilation
  options to -O2 -Wall that caused and error message on Solaris
  and Alpha systems.
