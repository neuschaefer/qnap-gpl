         Technical notes on my code submission of 06 Oct 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Update timers when first power problem detected to
  eliminate timing window.
- Because of their importance, moved changeme, commfailure, commok,
  mainsback, and onbattery from <src>/examples to <src>/etc
- Copy changeme, commfailure, commok, mainsback, and onbattery
  into sysconfigdir by default.
- NOTE: the above script files should really be processed by
  ./configure to contain the correct locations for the executables 
  and for the mail program. This needs to be done, but in the
  mean time, they should not create any problems, and can be
  a valuable tool for notification.

Changes submitted this submission:
- See above.
