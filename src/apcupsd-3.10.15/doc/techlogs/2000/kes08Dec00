         Technical notes on my code submission of 08 Dec 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Integrated Riccardo's fixes to the automatic dependencies
  make problem with ./configure.
- Allow NIS process to run regardless of the configuration.
  Previously it ran only if the UPS was connected to the
  serial port.


Changes submitted this submission:
- Created a .in file for apcupsd.spec on the RedHat version
  that includes @VERSION@ so that it is automatically updated
  with each version.
- Changed the version in version.h not to have the apcupsd in
  front of the numbers, which was redundant.
- Hopefully this time, I corrected the on battery timers.
  I now start them when we first detect a power failure.   
- I've added a new time value, which is the last time the
  master contacted a slave.  This value is then put in the
  STATUS output as MASTERUPD.  Thus, in looking at the STATUS
  output, you can see if the slave is being updated from the
  master.
- Allow the Network Information Service process to be created
  in any configuration.
- Updated the trouble shooting section of the manual.
- Updated the Win32 source build instructions.
- Commented out the popup window calls on the Win32 version
  in apccontrol for powerfail and mainsback. These tend to be
  more annoying than helpful since usually you are very aware
  that the power has gone off, or you aren't there and the  
  unanswered dialogue boxes remain around a long time.
