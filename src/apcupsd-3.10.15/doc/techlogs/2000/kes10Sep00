         Technical notes on my code submission of 10 Sep 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- The bulk of my changes were to the Win32 subdirectory
  and have already been integrated by Riccardo.
- This release is one bug fix, some security improvements
  concerning file permissions, and manual updates.

Changes submitted this submission:
- In Makefile.in, I tightened down the file permissions
  by adding 744 to apccontrol.
- apcsetup.c: changed a character string from MAXSTRING
  to 1000 bytes in length. This is because the cababilities
  string in some APC models overflowed the buffer.
- Added a Pragma no-cache to multimon.c to keep the file
  from being cached.
- Deleted config.h.in from the source directory as it is
  now in the autoconf subdirectory.
- For the RedHat distribution changed permissions on
  apcupsd to 744, added 744 to the permissions of halt
  (both in /etc/rc.d/init.d).
- A number of manual updates including additions to 
  testing, and a new Trouble Shooting section that needs
  additional work (at least it is a beginning).
  I also cleaned up most of the HTML errors except in
  the bible where there still remain quite a number to
  be fixed.
- Updated /etc/apcupsd.conf correcting the version number
  and the spelling of TIMEOUT in one of the comments.
- Added changeme, commfailure, and commok scripts to 
  the examples directory that email root when one of those
  events occurs.
