         Technical notes on my code submission of 11 May 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Some additions to the manual, particularly concerning "dumb"  
  UPSes. Clarification of cable requirements.
  Added quick search tags to the configuration manual for
  use with the new configurator.
- Added a new option to allow apcupsd to do a powerkill before
  exiting when a power loss is detected.
- Joseph Acosta has been working on a nice Browser based configuration
  utility for creating apcupsd configuration files. I include his
  contribution in contrib/apcupsdconf  

Changes submitted this submission:
- Updated Makefile.in version to 3.7.2
- apcaction.c added code to call kill_power() before the
  shutdown if the kill_on_powerfail option is set.
- apcnet.c removed the terminate() from kill_net() it is now
  done in the main program.
- apcoptd.c
  Added the -p and --kill_on_powerfail option which causes apcupsd
  to issue a powerkill command before the shutdown command.  I
  have certain misgivings about this command, but it seems to be
  necessary in some cases.
- apcupsd.c
  added terminate() after the kill_power() and kill_net() subrotine
  calls as it is no longer done in these routines.
- Added a new directory contrib/apcupsdconf, which contains the submission
  of a Web browser based configuration utility for apcupsd submitted
  by Joe Acosta.
