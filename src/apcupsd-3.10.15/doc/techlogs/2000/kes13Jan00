         Technical notes on my code submission of 13 Jan 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- A linking problem on some systems occurred in the CGI
  libraries.
- I reverified that as best I can tell, except for the drop
  of priority to nobody in the servers, we have implemented
  all the ideas given by Vladimir in his patch. However,
  most have been done slightly differently due to the evolution
  of our code.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Modified cgi/Makefile.in to include -lm on all the links.
  I also parameterized the makefile a bit more.
- I added the necessary credits to the Apcupsd manual for the
  use of the gd 1.2 image libraries used to produce the bar
  graphs in our CGI programs.
