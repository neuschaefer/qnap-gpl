         Technical notes on my code submission of 16 Jan 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Bug fixes and documentation.

Changes submitted this submission:
- On the Solaris 7 system, apparently make -C does not work.
  I noticed this for the build of the cgi directory, so I
  modified the configure.in script to do an explicit cd.
- Due to some reported problems with the halt script on
  older RedHat systems, I reworked the awk script to
  work for more cases.  I also updated the messages
  that are printed by the RedHat make.
- Based on questions and the problems, I've enhanced the
  documentation a bit. Mainly, I added clearer examples
  of how to test things.
- I added a new STATUS output that includes humidity and
  termperature.
- I updated the client.c program to accept a host name
  on the command line.
- I added eeprom as a command line argument to apcaccess.
  I thought I had done this in a previous submission, but
  it seems to be missing.  This is important because the
  manual refers to apcaccess eeprom in many places and I
  prefer not to change it.
