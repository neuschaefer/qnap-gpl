         Technical notes on my code submission of 17 Jan 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Config/make fixes

Changes submitted this submission:
- I removed some of the CYGWIN tests since they were not
  working correctly. Unfortunately, I do not have the
  time to fix it now. 
- I fixed the problems I introduced in eliminating the make -C
  for the cgi directory.
- Please note I believe these problems exist for some of the 
  other subdirectories, and I was not able to find the time
  to fix them.
- I added the local host as the default in etc/hosts.conf and
  added a little more documentation.
