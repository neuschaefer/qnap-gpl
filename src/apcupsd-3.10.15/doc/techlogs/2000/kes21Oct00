         Technical notes on my code submission of 21 Oct 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Win32 updates
- Fixed some WinNT problems.
- Updated the manual for the Win32 version.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Implemented simple email.exe program to send email
  messages. This permits notification of important events
  by email on Win32.
- Implemented changeme, onbattery, mainsback, commfailure, and commok
  for Win32.
- Added make Makefile to Win32 Makefile.in
- Modified the Win32 syslog() routine to append to the
  events file if it is not already open. The events filename
  is hard coded since the configuration file may not have
  been opened yet.
- A few enhancements of error messages where I ran into problems
  and did not get enough information.
- Fixed win32/Makefile.in and Makefile.in to do a correct
  win32 installation.
- Corrected a problem reported by Bostjan Muller that caused
  the NT version to crash when used as a slave. Once again,
  NT does not pass open shared memory descriptors to child
  processes. I had to add explict attach_ipc() calls in the
  network master/slave child processes.
- Reworked the code submitted by André as it contained a
  number of errors. It remains to be tested as soon as this
  version is out.
- Updated the manual for installation of the Win32 version.
- Brought the master/slave example configuration files
  up to date and removed the EEPROM configuration statements.
- Updated the safe.apccontrol script in the examples directory
  to remove the printf statements, which are not necessary.
  Apparently on some systems, this caused the output to be
  blank (I observed it here too).
- Fixed a Solaris link problem in the cgi library.
