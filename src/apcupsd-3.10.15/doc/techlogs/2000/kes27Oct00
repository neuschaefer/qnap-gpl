         Technical notes on my code submission of 27 Oct 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Win32 updates
- Updated the manual for the Win32 version.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Additional work on the Windows email.exe program.
- Added binary_tar_file as object of make in win32
  directory, which makes a win32 binary tar file.
- Updated the apctest program some more to add
  time/date stamps for almost all operations, implemented
  kill_power option.
- Added VERSION, DATE, and LSMDATE to values updated by
  ./configure. This permits automatically building a tar file with the
  correct name.
- Updated the Win32 distribution README.txt file. Added documentation
  for Riccardo's setup.exe, updated the email script files to include
  the correct path for the shell. Moved a lot of the stuff into
  new directories win32/bin win32/etc and win32/examples.
- A lot of updates to the document for Win32 and support for
  the Back-UPS Office UPSes.
- Added proper support to apcserial.c for the 940-0119A cable
  used by the Back-UPS Office. This was based on the tests done
  by Jason A. Smith (many thanks Jason).
- Moderately improved the readability and enhanced the 
  version line printed by apcupsd by adding the build date.
