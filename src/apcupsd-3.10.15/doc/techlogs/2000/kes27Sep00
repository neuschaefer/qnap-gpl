         Technical notes on my code submission of 27 Sep 00
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Integrated fixes from Devin Reade -- many thanks.
- Did an Alpha Tru64 port
- "Completed" the Win32 port
- Lots of documenation updates.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Moved the version definition from Makefile.in
  to version.h. This makes it easier to change the
  version. Note, I added additional version fields
  that are not yet used, but might be useful.
- New changes to Makefile.in to support building of
  a Win32 version.  Still to be done make install for
  Win32.
- added a new program apctest.c, which tests dumb cables.
  More work is needed on this program.
- when rebuilding the configure file, ensure that old configure
  files are removed.
- if we create a sysconfdir, create it with 0755 permissions.
- Makefile.in: clean: remove only regular files of zero length (Devin Reade).
- apcaction.c: add new time variables to keep track of when
  we went on batteries. Also optimize the code to drastically
  reduce the number of time() calls and to call it only if
  really needed.
- apcaction.c: remove the LineDown variable, which is not used.
- apcaction.c: complain once every nine hours if the battery
  must be replaced.
- keep track of number of transfers to batteries and when
  last done.
- apcconfig.c: do correct casting of pointer to long so that
  it works on 64 bit machines.
- apcnet.c: move the master's IP address to a static variable.
  On Win32, the address was being released, which is perfectly
  reasonable.
- apcnet.c: rationalize the log_event types a bit.
- apcnet.c: if we get a bad bind, continue trying for 15 minutes.
- apcnet.c: remove invalid close()
- apcserial.c: set in/out serial port speeds for Alpha, CYGWIN,
  and Linux systems.
- apcserial.c: correct low battery signal for dumb UPSes using
  Custom Simple cable.
- apcsmart.c: add code to support # -> replace battery
- apcstatus.c: report new variables.
- apcupsd.c: unlink pid file before creating it.
- apcupsd.c: use open() to create the pid file, with 0644 permissions.
- apcupsd.c: vastly simplify becoming a daemon.
- apcupsd.c: make umask() set 022 (Devin Reade)
- apcupsd.c: close stdin, stdout, stderr
- autoconf/acconfig.h.in: add HAVE_OSF1_OS for Alpha
- autoconf/configure.in: fix Win32 stuff, remove old VERSION
  stuff; pull version from version.h; add Alpha stuff; add
  code to support --with-pid-dir=<dir>; 
- autoconf/configure.in: fixed HOST to have DISTNAME, previously,
  it was always NONE. 
- add distributions/alpha subdirectory with new Alpha port code.
- make RPM spec file for RedHat release -- lots of work!
- A number of new STATUS examples in the examples directory.
- Corrected a few minor errors in the master/slave examples.
- Corrected and added additional EVENT script files that email
  event messages.  These really should be standard.
- Reworked apc.h and apc_config.h to separate system stuff and
  machine dependencies. Also tweaked apc_defines.h
- win32 directory a number of changes.
