General:
- Improvements in master/slave timeout detection and error
  messages.
- New master connect/disconnect events (accontrol).
- Additional master/slave documentation.
- Document USB.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Create new events "masterconnect" and "mastertimeout", which
  are triggered when a slave detects that the master has connected
  and timedout respectively.
- Add mastertimeout and masterconnect scripts to etc.
- Cleanup the POWERFAIL file write as suggested by Neil.
- Add additional detail to master/slave error messages (in many cases
  the errno is now printed).
- Implement select() on accept() and on read() in master and slave
  to permit timing out master/slave.
- Implement CommLost status for master/slave communications.
- Fixed SuSE start/stop symbolic linking.  
- Implemented a generic apccontrol, which is placed in the 
  distribution directory. If a platform wants a customized version
  (openbsd, freebsd, sun), simply place the apccontrol in the 
  platform subdirectory and ensure that configure.in knows which
  one to make.
