General:
- Added Makefile to examples directory
- Modified main Makefile.in to do clean and distclean of examples
- Additional documentation.
- Major bug fix to USB driver.
- Removed the sleep 2d from the RedHat halt script.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added Makefile.in to examples directory. Updated
  configure.in and Makefile.in to handle it.  This
  does a clean, distclean as well as builds the sample
  programs.
- Removed the sleep 2d from the RedHat halt script as
  well as the exit. This should allow the script to run
  to completion and properly shutdown any raid devices.
  
  Other platforms to be done.
- Lots of documentation, more to be done.
- Started adding Dmsg (debug print code) to apclog.c.  Not
  yet complete.
- Removed some 4.0 code from apcstatus and apcaction.
- Fixed a major bug in the USB driver. I had done extensive
  testing, but always with a slave machine, forgetting that
  the path was different on the main machine.  Fixed the
  read_usb_ups() routine to return when the event is read
  allowing apcaction to do his work. Added a few additional
  small details.
- Updated the version.
