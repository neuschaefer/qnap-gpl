General:
- These are my changes to the sychronization
  code that Riccardo sent me 31 October.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Eliminated the get_raw_upsinfo() from apcaccess 
  for the status command because
  it was byte order and apcupsd version dependent. I
  replaced it using the network "status"  command.
  However the get_raw_upsinfo() is still used for
  the eprom option since it requires an enormous
  amount of information to work.  With a little more
  work, I may be able to eliminate the rawupsinfo
  command.
- Modified apcacces to assume that the "status" option
  was given if no option is specified. Thus 
   
    apcaccess

  produces the status output.
- There was a difference of coding convention between
  what Riccardo and I did for the drivers concerning
  the return status. I have changed from the old
  Unix style 0 meaning success to 0 meaning failure
  and 1 meaning success. This allows for much more
  readable code. As a consequence, I modified the
  return values for a number of drivers.
- I deleted apcupsd.conf from the main source directory.
- I corrected some minor problems in the distributions/sun
  apccontrol.sh.in script (new events and new script
  arguments).
