General:
- Hopefully, I merged in to 3.9.8 all the fixes that I made
  to 3.8.4. I'm not 100% sure because a general diff is not
  possible due to the new directory structure.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Copied the latest version of the 3.8.4 manual.
- Included all the fixes that I made to the distributions directory
  for 3.8.4 (lock file directory fixes and the exec in apcccontrol)
- Included the lock file search fix for version 3.8.4 made to 
  configure.in
- Included the fixes to the cgi directory made in 3.8.4
- Included all the last 3.8.4 techlogs 
- Moved 3.8.4 techlogs into a 3.8.4 subdirectory.
