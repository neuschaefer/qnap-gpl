General:
- Many improvements and enhancements to the manual.
- Generated PDF version of the manual that can be found
  in <src>/doc/manual/apcupsd.pdf
- Tested Smart UPS, USB UPS, and Dumb UPS successfully.
- Implement a smtp program to permit email messages
  from WinNT/Win2000 machines.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Corrected a bug in multimon reported by a user that
  prevented display of Temperature in Farenheit.
- Added code for APC Smart-UPS 370Ci as provided
  by a user (slightly modified).
- Modified the dumb driver to work correctly. This
  code needs additional testing/checking as I did
  not have the time for a full audit.
- Added a few changes to the new net driver that
  interfaces to an NIS server. Much work remains to
  be done to get it working properly. For the moment,
  it is in Riccardo's hands.
- Added the build date to apcupsd.conf.in
- Created a simple program in the examples directory
  called upsapm.c, which returns the string as expected
  by the kernel for an APM device. The format of the string
  is the same a found in /proc/apm.  This program allows
  the user to run the Battery applet and have it report
  the status of his UPS.
- Wrote an smtp program that allows sending of email
  messages. This program will work in a service context on
  WinNT and Win2000 machines, as well as everywhere else.
- Updated the win32 examples to use the smtp program.
