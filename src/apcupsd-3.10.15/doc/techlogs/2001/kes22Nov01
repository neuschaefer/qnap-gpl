General:
- Pulled in the latest copy of the manual.
- Applied the changes as submitted by Carl Erhorn for
  Solaris. Most I pulled from Riccardo's integration
  into 3.9.7.
- Updated the version and date.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Applied a casting fix to apcnisd.c reported by the SCO user.
- Added NETWORK_UPS to the case statements in apctest,     
  apcreports, and apcstatus. This was the principal problem
  with the NIS network driver.
- Made some small updates to the Solaris configure.in changes
  so that sbindir is correctly set.
- Created an SCO subdirectory in distributions. This is just
  the very beginning please don't look at the code yet.
- In manual separated the Shutdown documentation into a separate
  chapter for people who are porting.
- Made a quick pass through the new network driver. Most everything
  was done. Here are the minor changes I made:
  - sorted the translation list to make it easier to find the entries
  - Added the remotedown flag so that the slave will be shutdown when
    the master goes down.
  - Added a few more debug messages which could be removed now.
  - Optimized fill_status_buffer() so that it does it at most once
    a second.
  - Used atof() on most of the input because even though they are
    stored as integers, they are passed over the net as decimal numbers.
  - used strtol() to get the status word, which is actually in hex.
  - Deleted a number of variables that should be locally set rather
    than pulled from the master.
- Fixed a bug in apcipc.c (non-fatal) found by the compiler on the SCO.

We need to think about the proper way to set CABLE and UPSMODE in the
status output for a new network driver. I think we should probably just
force them to something reasonable rather than take what the master
publishes.  To be decided.
