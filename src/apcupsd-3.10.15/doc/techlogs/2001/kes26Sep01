General:
- Pulled in the latest copy of the manual, which should
  significantly reduce support requests because I put
  the Models, Cables, and OSes supported into the index.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Changed the name of drivers/apcdrivers.c to drivers.c
  (no changes to drivers.c), also changed a few of the
  defines in the Makefile.   
- Added code to the apcsmart driver to set the RTS bit
  on the 0095 cables for the BackUPS Pro models. This
  enables Smart mode on those UPSes. It seems a bit odd
  to be using ioctl() for Smart models, but that is apparently
  what is needed.
- Removed the code in dumb_close() that reset the port
  parameters to conform 3.8.x code. This prevents unexpected
  power off conditions.
- Added new code to dumb_close() that clears the kill_power
  bit. This will prevent the serial port from possibly triggering
  a power kill later.
- Corrected an error message (flagged as incorrect by Riccardo) in
  dumbsetup.c.
              
Note, I have compiled and reviewed my changes, but they need
testing, which I will do when I receive the merge that Riccardo
has prepared.
