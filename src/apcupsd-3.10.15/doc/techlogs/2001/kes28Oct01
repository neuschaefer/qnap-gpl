General:

Changes submitted this submission:
- moved some device specific fields previously in
  the UPSINFO structure into the driver_internal_data
  location (defined structures for USB, APCSMART, and
  DUMB drivers).
- Added "debounce" code to wait 6 seconds between issuing
  the "Power problem detected" message and the "Power failure"
  message. This will prevent annoying messages for short
  power interruptions. The old 3.8.2 code worked this way
  because we previously blocked on a select() for 5 seconds.
  This no longer worked in 3.9.x because I changed to a slow
  select() of 60 seconds, and a fast select() of 1 second 
  after any power problem.
- I cleaned up the apcstatus.c code that was referencing the
  ioctl bits (and so removed the #warning message). In the
  process, I did a bit of cleanup of simple signalling code.
  When we switch to using the Status word, we will be able
  to simplify a lot of code!
- Enhancements to the document (ANNOY documentation, 
  runtime calibration documentation)
- Make USB driver detect different UPS and reset
  static data.
- Increase number of events that are saved and 
  reported from 10 to 50.
- Modified USB code to signal that the USB connection was
  lost only after 2 retrys of 5 seconds each. This should
  reduce the noise level a bit.
