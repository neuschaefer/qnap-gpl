Hey Kern,

One of my TrinityOS users sent me this graph.  Overall,
I have NO idea how the Utility ramped up the voltage
like that (bizzar) and I've asked for more info.

Anyway, the graph is pretty cool though something is
really bothering me.  Where is the "UPS LOAD" line?
It isn't the "magenta" line as that is the BattV line.
(I'm working on moving the graph key to some other spot
on the graph).

Here is some of the data I'm getting from that 700VA
SmartUPS using APCUPSd:

(sorry for the line wrap (if any))
 From this, I gather the data is:

IN  IN   OUT  BATT  OUT  Batt  UPS   IN V.
LOW HIGH  V    V     Hz  Char  Temp   now


But at home, I still use Powerchute on a SmartUPS 1400
and I get:

--
01/18/02,07:53:29,120.9,122.8,121.5,54.55,60.00,039.0,037.3,     ,
01/18/02,07:53:39,120.9,122.2,121.5,54.55,60.00,039.0,037.3,     ,
01/18/02,07:53:49,120.9,122.2,121.5,54.55,60.00,037.9,037.3,     ,
--

IN  IN   OUT  BATT  OUT  UPS  UPS
LOW HIGH  V    V     Hz  Load Temp


How can I get "UPS load" out of the 700VA unit?  Is this
a firmware issue on the 700?  Is there a set of commands
I can use to possibly configure the UPS to give me this
output or at least confirm that it cannot give me these
details?


Ps.  At the top of the APCUPSd log, you can see that SYSLOG
      surpressed a duplicate line.  Do you know if there is
      a way to disable this?  Overall, it obviously won't
      change the graph output but it might be a good thing
      to tell my users about.
