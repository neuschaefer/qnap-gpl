General:
- New cable design for BackUPS CS models to run it
  in Smart serial mode.
- Corrected a major bug in the smart and net code where the
  status word was getting clobbered.

Changes submitted this submission:
- A few days ago, slither_man sent me an email with some 
  information on how to run a BackUPS CS in smart mode with
  a serial cable.  He found the information by assuming that
  the UPS supported Smart mode and through trial and error.
  Well, it works!!!!!!! Amazing!!!! Thanks slither_man.
- Documentation for new CUSTOM-RJ54 cable that can be constructed
  from the end of an ethernet cable and a DB9F connector.
