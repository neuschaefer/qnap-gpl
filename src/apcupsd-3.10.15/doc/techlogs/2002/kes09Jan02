General:
- Integrated the OpenServer patch sent to me by Riccardo,
  who had integrated the submission by Kamal.
- Integrated Kamal's enhancement of his previous work
  to truncate the events file.


Changes submitted this submission:
- Based on a user input (Jim Pennino), I added a patch
  that ensures that if FILENAME_MAX is less than 50
  it is set to 256. On HP it is 14, and we use it for
  our maximum pathname length.
- Modified a few apccontrol.sh.in files in the distribution
  directory to be stamped with the apcupsd version number.
