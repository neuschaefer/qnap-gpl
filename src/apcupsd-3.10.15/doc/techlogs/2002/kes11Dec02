General:
- Tried to correct problems with Makefiles
- Thanks to David Walser who pointed out where on the Sun, the make
  install was doing terrible things -- I found that there was
  a missing semicolon in the new Makefile.  Before my previous cleanup,
  there were actually 4 missing semicolons.  Hopefully this
  will correct the problem.
- For a second time, David Walser came to the rescue finding the
  CGI install problem reported by lots of people.  The new code
  used "make" instead of $(MAKE) to call the CGI make.  Fixed.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Removed Makefile code that creates and sets permission bits on
  /tmp $(prefix) and $(exec-prefix)
- Removed all occurrences of -z in the Makefiles (at least that I
  found) and replaced them with a more conservative formulation.
- Removed the install-symlinks script that caused some problems
  on distributions with blanks in the DISTVER name.
- Added install-symlinks to the suse Makefile.in. This is the
  only platform that currently uses it.
