General:

Changes submitted this submission:
- Based on recent emails concerning the cable wiring for
  the 940-0128A cable, I updated the document and did
  some testing.
- Modified apctest to perform a shutdown test for
  USB UPSes.  
- Removed the device_close() statements from kill_power()
  as they should not be there.
- Removed the generation of the reboot for dumb UPSes after
  a kill power. Previous comments indicated that they should
  be removed, and now they are commented out.
  This change is essential for the apctest code to work for
  a USB UPS.
- Made another attempt at getting USB kill power to work.
  I've left a good deal of debug code in the source -- until
  it all works.
