General:
- Merged in changes sent by Riccardo and by Kamal
  ric05Jan02 ric13Jan02 kam03Jan02 kam05Jan02
  Actually Riccardo did a lot of the merging. I've
  sort of lost track.
- See also dr20Jan02 and mb07Jan02
- Significant changes to the usb driver to handle
  the SmartUPS in usb mode.
- Copied over the latest tech logs from 3.8.5.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Made apctest build on Win platforms.
- Apcupsd now needs -lm option because usb driver uses
  the pow() function to do proper unit scaling.
- Added wait_time to the UPSINFO structure which gives an
  indication to the driver of how much time to wait. This
  takes a bit of calculation (see apcdevice.c) because
  of data and status reports that my have faster times.
  The driver can still adjust this time if necessary,
  as the DUMB and NET drivers do.
- Enhanced the data logging to include Ambient temperature
  and humidity as well as correct a wrong value.
- Added some new status word bits:
   UPS_SHUTDOWNIMM
   UPS_BELOWCAPLIMIT
   UPS_REMTIMELIMIT
  They remain to be implemented.
- Moved a good part of the USB specific capability arrays into
  the USB driver. We could do likewise for other drivers.
- Pulled over the French translation of the messages from 3.8.5
- Updated the version to 3.9.8-22Jan02
