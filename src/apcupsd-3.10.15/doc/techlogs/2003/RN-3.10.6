          Release Notes for Apcupsd 3.10.6

General:
This new release has been in the works for over two years,
and it represents a significant and fundamental change
in apcupsd due to the efforts of Riccardo Faccetti that is the
addition of UPS drivers allowing apcupsd to be more easily adapted
to different UPS architechtures.

Changes since apcupsd 3.10.6

- Integrated Alexander Schremmer's stdout fix for Windows --
  keeps debug printout from being sent to the serial port.
- Bob Kuo found a bug that caused a seg fault for newer USB
  UPSes. The error was that my code walked off the end of a
  table in linux-usb.c if the USB code was not in the
  table.

Major Changes since version 3.8.6 this Release:

- The manual has been totally rewritten/reorganized by
  Eric S. Raymond. Thanks.
- Support for USB UPSes.
- Full kill power for USB UPSes is supported if you have
  a kernel 2.4.22 or higher, or you apply the kernel
  patch supplied by Sergey Vlasov.  See the examples directory.
- Version 3.10.6 (as opposed to 3.8.x) has device specific drivers,
  and thus can have a much smaller footprint by turning off unused
  drivers and parts of the code. See the new ./configure options.
- There is a new networking driver (net) that uses the NIS interface
  rather than the older master/slave networking. It is very
  simple to setup, but has certain disadvantages -- for details 
  see the manual
- Win32 daemons work much better with a new version of cygwin.
- Using a special cable (easy to build), you can run your APC
  USB UPSes in serial mode.
- The apctest program has been enhanced to do EEPROM programming in
  a much more interactive way than the prior versions.

Other Changes this Release:

- The rpms now build without being root.
- A number of bug fixes.
- Support for additional systems, UPSes, and cables.
- Support for system gd program rather than older version we supply.
- pthreads is turned on by default, and we no longer support the
  old forking version. We have left the code in case anyone needs
  it, but there is some fixing to do to make it work.


Items to note:  !!!!!
- The default NIS port has changed from 7000 to 3551. Port 3551 has been
  officially assigned to apcupsd by IANA.
- A number of directive names have changed since 3.8.6, so please check
  your .conf file carefully, or better yet, rename your old version so    
  that apcupsd will install the new one, then make any minor modifications
  that you need.
