Apcupsd-3.10.9 Release Notes

**************************************************
*This rpm release contains some important changes*
**************************************************

The platform designator (rh7, rh8, rh9) has been
REMOVED from the package names as this was creating
some problems. Hence, you CAN NOT upgrade existing
installations with these packages (rpm -U).

To upgrade:
1. Backup your configuration files (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf)
"just to be safe."
2. Uninstall the old apcupsd package, ie.
rpm -e apcupsd-usb-rh9
If you are not sure what package name is installed do
rpm -qa | grep apcupsd
3. Install the new package with rpm -i

In addition, the spec file has been reworked to include a
platform configuration section at the beginning of the file.
To rebuild the SRPM, first install using rpm -i then edit
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/apcupsd.spec (or whatever directory
structure your platform uses) to set platform options and
select whether to build usb support. You may also pass the
defines on the command line as in the past. You only need to
specify the platform for RH7.x builds.

*************************
*Future Platform Support*
*************************

RedHat 9 and perhaps 8 will continue to be supported for the
forseeable future. Whitebox Enterprise Linux support is
added with this release as I intend to migrate my server
(currently RH8) to that platform. I may also continue to provide 
RH8 packages by setting up a box for that purpose.

There is no intent to provide Fedora Core packages as neither
one of us wishes to get on that upgrade treadmill, however I
expect the SRPM will continue to build on that platform for some time.
