General:
- Added error messages if old master/slave code called.
- Reworked the messages for ./configure --help to be aligned and
  clearer for networking and master/slave
- A number of important patches all supplied by Mirko Doelle.
- Moved technotes for 2001 and 2002 into respective directories.
- Created a new kes-3.10.4 file to which I will append if there
  are additional changes to 3.10.4. This will reduce the number
  of release note files.

  Thanks to Mirko Doelle for reporting this.

  $(topdir)/autoconf.  Reported by Mirko.

  first. Code sent by Mirko, but I modified it slightly.
