General:

Changes submitted this submission:
03Feb03
- Sanitize messages before passing them to syslog() to avoid
  %n exploit.
- Added an avsnprinf() routine.          
- Replaced all vsprintf() calls with avsnprintf() to close a
  master/slave exploit that was published.
- Remove awk processing of halt script for Mandrake as suggested by
  David Walser.
02Feb03
- Corrected --enable-oldnet to be --enable-master-slave as I
  had intended. Thanks to David Walser for pointing this out.
- Added David Walser's apcupsd.spec.in for Mandrake and his
  changes to configure.in.
