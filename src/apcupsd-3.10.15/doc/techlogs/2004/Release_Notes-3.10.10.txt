These release notes detail changes in the rpm packages. Please 
see the release notes in the tarball for other changes.

*****************************************************************
* This rpm release contains some important changes since 3.10.8 *
*****************************************************************

The platform designator (rh7, rh8, rh9) has been
REMOVED from the package names as this was creating
some problems. Hence, you CAN NOT upgrade existing
3.10.8 or lower installations with these packages (rpm -U).

To upgrade:
1. Backup your configuration file (/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf)
"just to be safe."
2. Uninstall the old apcupsd package, ie.
rpm -e apcupsd-usb-rh9
If you are not sure what package name is installed do
rpm -qa | grep apcupsd
3. Install the new package with rpm -i

*****************
* Other Changes *
*****************

- This release adds the net driver which was missing from previous builds.

- The usb serial port device has been set to BLANK in the usb package which 
will cause apcupsd to search all known locations. This eliminates the problem 
with the "nonstandard" locations which were used in RedHat 7.x. The previous
patch used to fix that has been eliminated.

******************
* Platform Notes *
******************

We now have a dedicated box dual-booting RedHat 7.3 and 8.0 for the purpose of
providing continued packaging support as long as it is desired. All packages 
are built with all of the latest applicable updates applied. In the case of
RedHat 7 and 8 we are pulling in the latest Progeny updates as well thanks to
the folks at http://oss.redundant.com/pub/party-updates/
