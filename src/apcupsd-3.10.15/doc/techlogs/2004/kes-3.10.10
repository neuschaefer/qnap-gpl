General:
- Based on observations that Adam Kropelin has made on a problem UPS,
  I've modified the USB driver to poll for the dynamic UPS data a maximum
  of once every 5 seconds, unless it is on batteries.         
- I added a new "offbattery" event that is only executed if the 
  "onbattery" event was executed. This should allow users to easily
  control what messages they get and by using the ONBATTERYDELAY the
  time on batteries before the onbattery event is notified.
