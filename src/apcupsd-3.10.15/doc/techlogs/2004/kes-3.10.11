General:
- Correct apccontrol script to remove extra ;; that I inadvertantly
  left the last release -- apparently that prevented proper shutdown.
- Updates to manual as requested by Adam and other users.
- Fix localtime_r in configure.in as reported with patch by Adam.
- Fixed bad html in multimoncss.c reported by an anonymous user.
- Added new Mandrake apcupsd.spec.in submitted by David Walser.
- Revert to using the old master/slave networking code bu default.
