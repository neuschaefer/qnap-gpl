General:
- Thanks to Joseph Sacco, we have Yellow dog support -- and he
  has tested and validated it!
- Integrated Joseph Sacco's yellowdog patch -- some done by hand.
- Minor updates to the documentation from user input.
- Fix a Makefile find that removes zero length files, which fails                 
  on some systems.
- Web site update.
- Apply patch from Adam that fixes OpenBSD and FreeBSD pthreads 
  library bugs.
- Add poll time to SNMP driver, and correct header file prototyping.
- Make usb driver sleep for 1 second then retry up to 10 times
  if the device cannot be opened. There are two such loops so in
  the event of failure, it will occur 20 seconds later. This
  allows time for the hotplug program to initialize the USB devices
  after a boot.
- Cleanup crap generated by doc book for web manual
- Turned on strict prototype checking.
- William King has made a number of commits to bring the cgi
  html up to current xhtml standards -- many thanks.
- Changed start level from 20 to 60 to ensure that DNS is started. 
  Reported by David Walser.
- Remove some unused code in the snmp directory.
- Cleanup some compile errors in the snmp directory.
- Move install.xml to install.kml and implement simpler html directives in
  docbook.  Modify Makefile to convert html back into docbook.
- Change references to serial port in apctest to device (USB included).
