             Technical notes on version 3.10.14
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
28Jul04
- Add workaround from Adam for linux/hiddev.h missing define.
- Updates to manual.
- Integrate patch for Mandrake apcupsd.in forwarded by David Walser.
18Jul04
- Found another store into the ups buffer so #ifdefed it. Cannot
  store into the ups buffer on non-pthreads systems.
17Jul04
- Fiddle with apcconfig.c to correct astrncpy() problem noted by
  Adam.
- #ifdef code in apcaccess that tries to write in the shared memory
  buffer.
- Applied Adam's patch for fixing the pthreads dependencies in asys.c
- Tweak the patch a bit hopefully so that OpenBSD will work.
09Jul04
- Made a sweep through quite a few files updating the copyright, 
  eliminating the disclaimer (now in DISCLAIMER), and adding as many
  astrncpy() and astrncat()s as I could find. There still remain some
  drivers and the cgi code to do.
- Implemented true/false and bool. Started implementing it in many of
  the files I touched.
- Updated the net driver and did a fairly good testing of it.
- Made apcupsd remain in the foreground when doing a kill power.
- Eliminated some of the error messages during kill power by not
  doing useless things.
- Added back code to print what is happening during kill power
  in the USB code.
- Corrected a few of the USB error messages that could have been
  missleading or confusing.
- Eliminated some inappropriate usages of size_t.
20Jun04
- Integrated a number of updates into the manual, particularly from
  Adam.
- Put wall as ${WALL} in platforms/apccontrol.in
- If the IP address is 0.0.0.0 force it to localhost in apcaccess.
- Integrat Thomas Habets' changes to keep connect() from blocking
  in apcnet.c so that apcupsd can service more slaves.
- Ensure that stdin/out/err are allocated in daemon_start() of apcuspd.c
- Update snmp.c with bug fix from Bacula.
- Bill has made numerous changes to improve the code such as adding
  consts where appropriate.
