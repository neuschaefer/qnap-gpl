Thanks, Kern.  I've tested it with a Linux RH 6.2 master and
an OpenBSD 2.7 slave.  Your 25 Feb snapshot fixes both issues.
Thanks for your efforts.

I have also attached a minor patch relative to your 25 Feb
snapshot.  It addresses the following issues:

   - elimination of an unnecessary lock file for OpenBSD
   - change of lockfile path for OpenBSD
   - allow for some Makefiles to not exist during 
   - recursive makes (platform independent)
   - cleaned up restart code for OpenBSD

FWIW, since I have (new)BackupsPro UPSes, I didn't use the exact
test you mentioned (unplugging the serial cable), but rather
killed the master, waited a bit, then restarted it.  This shows
the problem with 3.8.1, and shows it fixed with the 25 Feb patch.
