         Technical notes on version 3.8.1-3 (5 Mar 01)
                   Kern Sibbald

General:
- This version has a few bug fixes, and is for
  limited distribution to test bug fixes.
- Some files have large diff files because they
  have been reformatted to apcupsd 4.0 standards.
- I am in the process of integrating version 4.0
  code into this stream, so many of the changes are
  related to this activity.
- Modified code for handling 940-0095B cable. Hopefully,
  it will work now.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added the Caldera code that was submitted by John Pinner.
- Added more of Riccardo's 4.0 fixes to this version (apclist)
  renamed apcserver.c as apcnis.c, etc.
- Added the KILLDELAY configuration directive, but the code
  to implement it will have to wait for the state machine
  apcaction.c code.
- Merged apcexec.c up to version 4.0 code.
- Added apclist.c from version 4.0.
- Reindented apcnet.c
- Changed calling sequence of detach_ipc() to agree with 4.0
- Removed unused code from apcnetlib.c
- Reindented apcserial.c
- Changed calling sequence to execute_command() to agree with
  version 4.0.
- Implemented core_ups in limited way -- points to the only UPS.
  This allows much of 4.0 code to be integrated unchanged.
- Changed calling sequence to start_thread() to agree with 4.0
- Integrated NetBSD patches that I received from Devin Reade -- thanks.
