General:
- Minor bug fixes prior to 3.8.2 release.
- Some documentation.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Brought ChangeLog up to date.
- Moved old ChangeLog to ChangeLog.old
- Removed the chmod +t apcnisd since it doesn't
  work on some systems.
- In prior release: modified apcaccess to work with
  pthreaded apcupsd. It requires the NIS server and
  you can specify a host and port as an optional 
  second argument. This works across the network 
  providing the two machines are of identical architecture.

    apcaccess status host:port   

- Same for powerflute.
- After generating an event (usually a message, possibly
  email) for change battery five times, apcupsd resets the
  change battery flag. This should help avoid false alarms
  which are extremely rare. Previously apcupsd had to be
  restarted to clear this condition.
- Deleted a useless message in apcsetup.c
- Ensure that argvalue is properly terminated.
- Modified upsimage.c to produce slightly better looking
  graphs if the voltage or output voltage is less than
  80 volts.
- Fixed an installation problem (fat fingered data) in 
  configure.in for SuSe systems.
- Implement localtime_r() which is reentrant.
- Moved old techlogs into subdirectories 1999 and 2000.
  This makes it easier to see the most recent techlogs.
