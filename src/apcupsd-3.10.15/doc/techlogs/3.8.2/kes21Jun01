General:
- Fixed bug in creation of PWRFAIL file. Thanks to
  José for his excellent testing efforts.
- Cleaned up configuration of PWRFAILDIR in 
  distribution files.
- Fixed installation of multimon.css
- Implemented localtime_r() for Win32 systems.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Due to inconsistencies in the way filenames
  were constructed, the powerfail path required
  a trailing slash. Without the slash, the path
  and the filename were run together, as was
  the default case.  This is now fixed.
  This bug (since approximately Beta8) prevented
  the UPS power from being shutoff.
- If the powerfail file or nologin file cannot
  be created, a log message is generated with
  the reason (e.g. read-only filesystem).
- Cleaned up some PTHREADS flags on the FreeBSD
  system as suggested by Neil.
- Noticed that a number of installation scripts 
  did not get modified to handle the powerfail
  file configuration. (HPUX, Sun, unknown, Alpha,
  Debian, OpenBSD, RedHat, Slackware, SuSe)
- Corrected the bug in the installation of the
  multimon.css file. It should now install corrrectly
  on all systems.
- Added _THREAD_SAFE and _REENTRANT flags to compiles 
  for threaded version (thanks Neil).
- Added code to implement localtime_r() on Win32 systems
  since it does not exist in libc.
