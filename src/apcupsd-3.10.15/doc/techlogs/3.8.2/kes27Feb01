         Technical notes on version 3.8.1-25Feb01

General:
- This version has a few bug fixes, and is for
  limited distribution to test bug fixes.

Changes submitted this submission:
- Added NetBSD code submitted
- Corrected the make depend to only update the Makefile
  rather than both Makefile and Makefile.in
- Added a new AVERSION define to version.h which is meant
  to allow us to maintain source code with multiple
  versions.
- Reformatted apcaction.c to Riccardo's 4.0 standards
- Modified apcaction.c to be compatible with version 4.0
- Changed start_thread() to start_child().
- Changed clean_threads() to terminate_children().
- In apcexec.c changed calling sequence of execute_command()
  to conform to version 4.0 (added UPSINFO argument).
- To correct a problem with zombies on BSD systems, I added
  a UPSINFO variable that is the count of children created
  by execute_command(). do_action() in apcaction.c was
  modified to check this variable, do a non-blocking wait,
  and decrement it if any children were found.  This should
  properly reap the zombies.
- Added additional debug information (strerror) to failed
  semaphore and shared memory system call errors in apcipc.c
- In apcnet.c, removed ChangeBatt from slave because it is
  apparently being set incorrectly on some BSD masters when
  apcupsd is restarted.
- Added an O_NDELAY to the serial port open() in apcserial.c
  to avoid infinite waits on some BSD systems. This required
  the addition of an fcntl() after the open to reset the
  blocking read(), which is needed in apcupsd.
- Removed an unwanted break in a switch in apcstatus.c that
  caused the status output for BackUPS Pros to be cut short.
- Added a HAVE_POWERFLUTE define and changed powerflute.c to
  use it. This prevents a lot of the errors seen on systems
  that don't have ncurses.
- configure.in, added HAVE_NETBSD_OS, HAVE_POWERFLUTE, and
  modified generation of makefiles to only configure the files
  in the recognized distribution.  Modified the automatic 
  make of the dependencies to use "make depend"
- Removed the call on the shell to execute a script file in
  apccontrol. This permits execution of any type of file, but
  it now requires that the file be executable.
- Corrected the error in the name of ANNOYDELAY in the man
  file as well as in the html manual.
- Added a number of updates and corrections to the html manual,
  thanks to reports from users.
- Updated all the script files in <src>/etc to correct the DoS
  problem that was reported by one of our users - thanks.
- added a new gupsc directory that has the GNOME realtime 
  monitoring program with very pretty dials. 
- Added num_execed_children variable to UPSINFO structure.
- Added .bat files to the win32/bin directory as they seem
  to be more reliable than the .pif files especially on WinNT.
- Enhanced shutdown.c in win32 to try a simple shutdown, but
  on NT, it also does an InitiateSystemShutdown.
