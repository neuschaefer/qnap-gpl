I (Kern) received the following code submission and applied it.
Giulio is really very good with RPMs -- thanks.

Hi,

I've made some modification to the spec file to make it more general and able to
produce the right rpm both on rh6x and rh7x: 1 spec file for all rpms.
It produces rpms with the same name, it would be easy to change it to query the
system where it's running and produce rpms with different names.

I attach the diff in case you want to check it (just one spec for rh6 and rh7
saves time..).

Differences with the official rpm (8.2-1):
- the "release" (in the way it's used in the original spec) is something for rpm
only, the tar.gz should be just 8.2.tar.gz
- does not own /etc/rc.d/init.d /sbin /usr/man/man8
- uses rpm FHS macros (%{_mandir}, ...)
- owns /etc/apcupsd /etc/apcupsd/cgi
- uses "make install" to install all the stuff (note: "make install" does not
install multimonnocss.cgi)
- removes old stuff using less commands
- preun only if uninstall and not for upgrade
- all /etc/apcupsd/* scripts  are marked config(noreplace) so that if someone
customizes them, they are preserverd after an rpm upgrade.
