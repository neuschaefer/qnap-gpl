General:
- Fixed multimoncss.c so that the Normal class is used in
  the Temperature and Humidity columns.
- Added #include <time.h> to multimon.c and multimoncss.c
  to avoid compiler warnings.
- Modified a number of startup scripts (RedHat, HP, SuSe, Caldera,
  Slackware, and unknown).
  so that the subsystem lock file is created in /var/lock/subsys
  rather than /var/lock.           
- Added 940-0127A and 940-0128A cables to be the same as the
  940-0119A cable.
