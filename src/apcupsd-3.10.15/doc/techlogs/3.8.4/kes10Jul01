General:
- Updated manual to include ideas/suggestions received
  from users installing 3.8.2.
- Fixed safe.apccontrol to be a bit more system independent 
  (thanks to Steven Orr for the idea).
- Added safe.apccontrol.in so that it is configured properly.
- Added a big warning message to the end of the ./configure
  output if /usr/ucb is on your path.
- Fixed reference to lock file in Solaris apcupsd.in so it is
  properly configured.
- Removed unused variable from Solaris apcupsd.in
