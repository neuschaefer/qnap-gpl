             Technical notes on version 3.8.3 
                      10 September 2001
                        Kern Sibbald

General:
- Pulled in the latest copy of the manual, which corrects a number
  of errors reported by users.
- updated all the distribution/apccontrol files to reboot  the
  machine if the mains comes back after a power failure and the
  shutdown is cancelled. This will prevent the machine from being
  left in an unstable state.
- updated all the halt scripts in the distributions script to
  remove the sleep commands after the killpower. This will allow
  the halt script to run to completion and to synchronize any
  raid devices (often done in the final steps by the kernel).
- applied the RedHat apcupsd.spec patch supplied by Giulio Orsero.
