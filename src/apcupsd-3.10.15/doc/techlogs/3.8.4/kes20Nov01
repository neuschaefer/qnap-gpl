General:
- Pulled in the latest copy of the manual.
- Applied the changes as submitted by Carl Erhorn for
  Solaris. Most I pulled from Riccardo's integration
  into 3.9.7.
- Applied a fix provided by a user to apcsetup.c that
  fixes the setup code for old Smart UPSes that are not
  so smart and that return a zero length capabilities
  string.
- Fixed apctest.c so that it creates the powerfail file
  for the powerfail test prior to calling kill_power,
  then deletes it afterward.
- Updated the version release date.
