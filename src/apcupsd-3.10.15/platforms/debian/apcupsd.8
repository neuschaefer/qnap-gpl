.SH NAME
apcupsd \- daemon for Most APCC's UPS support under Linux and UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /sbin/apcupsd 
.br
.B /sbin/powersc
.br
.B /etc/apcupsd.conf
.br
.B /sbin/apcaccess
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This daemon can be used for controlling the APC SmartUPS. During a power
failure, "apcupsd" will inform the users about power status. If the power
is restored before valid test return TRUE, "apcupsd" will inform users
about this fact. If power is not restored, a system shutdown will follow
when the battery is exausted, a timeout (seconds) expires, or runtime
minutes based on internal values based on power consumption rates. The
whole shutdown is now made by script calls to the "/sbin/powersc"
file called by "apcupsd", so no changes in the inittab are necessary.
There is now no communication between "apcupsd" and init(1) process.
.LP
The "apcupsd" daemon now supports the networking mode. In this mode,
one machine is configured as a master, with UPS attached to the serial
port. Other machines (max. 20) are configured as a slaves. Master has a
network connection with slaves and send them informations about UPS
status. Both Master and Slaves open and close there sockets on a regular
basis. If someone gets lost nobody gets to upset.
.LP
.B Hewlett Packard 
: HP PowerTrust 2997A UPS has been tested as a "smartups" with cable
Hewlett Packard part number 5061-2575 as "CUSTOM-SMART".
.LP
Slackware, RedHat, S.u.S.E., Debian, and UNIFIX "FLAVORS" of Linux have
direct  install support.  All other "FLAVORS" of Linux will need some
fussing with to get the install correct. Please send me all new install
methods that are not listed above or corrections to these for future
versions before the final release.
.SH CONFIGURATION
It is necessary to write configuration info to the file "/etc/apcupsd.conf".  
This file is a plain ASCII file and you can use your favorite editor for
configuration. For simple configuration, see enclosed sample file.

.br
[ netslave | netmaster ] are valid types.
.br
[ standalone | netslave | netmaster ] are tested classes.
.br
[ shareslave | sharemaster ] classes are being tested.
.LP
Default for all machines is "standalone". Change to "shareslave" if and
only if you are using a ShareUPS and connected to a BASIC Port with
Simple Signal. Change to "sharemaster", if and only if you are using a
ShareUPS and connected to the ADVANCED Port Smart Signal control.
Change to "netslave" if and only if you are not connected to an UPS
other than for power.  Change to "netmaster", if and only if you are
on a TCP/UDP network and connected to an UPS of any kind with other
Linux Boxes.
.LP
.B  UPSMODE -- 
[ disable | share | net | sharenet ] are valid types.
.br
.LP
[ disable | net ] are the only known and tested classes.
.br
[ share | sharenet ] classes is being tested.
.LP
BETA [ share ] For two or seven (2/7) additional simple signal
ports on a SmartAccessories(tm) (internal/external box) for SmartUPSes.
.LP
.B  DEVICE
-- <name of serial port>
.br
Please specify which device is used for UPS communication.
The default is /dev/ttyS[0|1|2|3].
.LP
.B  LOCKFILE
-- <path to lockfile>
.br
By supplying this argument, "apcupsd" tries to create a lockfile in
the specified directory.
.LP
.B  ACCESS
-- [ true | false ]
.br
This enables the use of "apcaccess" interface, on all machines, but
for accessing or changing configurations of a running "apcupsd".
.LP
.B  ANNOY
-- <time in seconds>
.br
Please specify time in seconds for "apcupsd" to harrass logged in
users to get off the system.
.LP
.B  DELAY
-- <time in seconds>
.br
Please specify time in seconds for "apcupsd" to delay harrassing
logged in users to get off the system. This rate is reset if there
is a power state change. If "ANNOY == DELAY" then "DELAY" is disabled.
.LP
.B  NOLOGON
-- <method of setting nologon file>
.br
[ disable | timeout | percent | minutes | always ] are valid types.
.br
Based on Ten (10) percent of a setting.
This allows one to define the point when the /etc/nologin file is added.
This is important for allowing systems with BIG UPSes to run as normal
until the SA determines the need for dumping users. The feature also allows
the SA hold of the "ANNOY" factor until the /etc/nologin file is added.
.LP
.B  PROCFS
-- <time in seconds>
.br
Please specify time in seconds for "apcupsd" to update the psuedo
proc fs file "/etc/apcupsd.status". This rate is reset if there is
a power state change.
.LP
This will be replaced with "apcaccess 'status'" calls. This will prevent
fragmenting and disk access.
.LP
.B  LOGGING
-- <time in seconds>
.br
Please specify time in seconds for "apcupsd" to update the log file
"/var/log/apcupsd.log". This rate is reset if there is a power state change.
.br
Future additions will allow one to select the location of the logfile.
.LP
.B  TIMEOUT
-- <time in seconds>
.br
This is the timeout between power failure and system shutdown.
The timeout for master is always 30 seconds longer than slaves.
.LP
.B  BATTERYLEVEL
-- <percent of battery>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
Instead of setting "TIMEOUT", apcupsd can react based on the remaining
charge left in the batteries.
.LP
.B  MINUTES
-- <battery runtime in minutes>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
Instead of setting "TIMEOUT", apcupsd can react based on the internal
calculations of runtime in minutes as related to power consumption
being drawn on the UPS.
.LP

-- <set wakeup delay>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
The power restart delay value in [0,60,180,300] Cycles.
This is important for those who have high RPM drives that need
to spindown or they will fault out when booting. Some SCSI models
are very sensitive to this problem. Cycles(*)
.LP
.B  SLEEP
-- <set sleep delay>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
Delay in [20,180,300,600] Cycles before the actual killpower event.
Cycles(*)
.LP
.B  LOTRANSFER
-- <sets lower limit of ups batt. transfer>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
This sets the low line voltage point to switch over.
.br
There are four values that can be selected, but they vary based on
the UPS model, classification, and manufacture date. Thus a value
ranging from 0-3 are assigned the learned and bubble sorted values.
.LP
.B  HITRANSFER
-- <sets upper limit of ups batt. transfer>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
This sets the high line voltage point to switch over.
.br
There are four values that can be selected, but they vary based on
the UPS model, classification, and manufacture date. Thus a value
ranging from 0-3 are assigned the learned and bubble sorted values.
.LP
.B  RETURNCHARGE
-- <sets min. batt. charge level>
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
There are four values that can be selected, but they vary based on
the UPS model, classification, and manufacture date. Thus a value
ranging from 0-3 are assigned the learned and bubble sorted values.
.LP
.B  BEEPSTATE
-- <sets alarm beep state> 
.br
Valid for UPSes capable of Internal EPROM programming.
.br
This allows the setting of the noise maker that many have removed
because of the annoiance factor.  These settings are based on discrete
events related to the remaining capacity of the UPS.
.br

This is normally an eight character string, but it currently
only handles seven.
.LP
.B XXXXCMD's
.br
All of the following commands are used to execute external scripts
of programs that "apcupsd" does not handle internally. Specifically
something like calling a pager or sending email to a System or
Network Admin.
.br
.B [ BATTCMD | TIMECMD | LOADCMD | LIMITCMD ]
.br
.B [ PWRCMD | RETCMD | REMOTECMD ]
.br
are the seven external commands that can access and report
events.

is now passed to the slaves to sync. the openning of a socket
by the slave for the master.
.LP
.B  NETPORT
-- <TCP|UDP port number>
.br
This unix service port number must be set in the /etc/services file
as follows:

without spaces. This is passed to the master machine during
initialization of sockets. This string should be different for
each and every slave on the network.
.SH SMARTUPS
If you start getting the follow message:
.br
.B Emergency, Batteries Have Failed!!!!
.br
.B Change Them NOW!!!
.br
Act upon it quickly. It means what it says.
.br
Also, not all "SmartUPS" models are eqaully smart. A non-NET or old
class of "SmartUPS" has a subset of the full UPSlink(TM) language,
and can not be polled for its control codes.
.LP
.B TIMEOUT, BATTERYLEVEL, and MINUTES
can be set togather without problems. The daemon will react to the
first case or test that is valid.
.SH SHAREUPS
Special note for ShareUPS users,
.B TIMEOUT, BATTERYLEVEL, and MINUTES
are disabled or set to default values. Currently, there is not a known
way of early signals to be sent to BASIC Ports. MINUTES are set to 0.
.SH CABLES
.br
Firstly, you will need the cable between APC Smart UPS and PC computer
running Linux. You can use either the special cable which is enclosed with
the PowerChute (TM) software or you can make your own cable connected as
follows:
.LP
        SMART-CUSTOM
.br
        PC (9 pin)      APC (9 pin)
.br
        2 RxD           2
.br
        3 TxD           1
.br
        5 GND           9
.LP 
        SIMPLE-CUSTOM
.br
 DB9/25F PC Side                DB9M UPS Side
.br
  4/20   DTR (5vcc)                  nc    (*)
.br
   8/5   CTS (low-batt)               5    (*)
.br
   2/3   RxD (other line-fail)        3    (*)
.br
   5/7   Ground (Signal)              4
.br
   1/8   CD (line-fail from ups)      2
.br
   7/4   RTS (shutdown ups)           1
.br
  nc/1   Frame/Case Gnd (optional)    9
.LP
List if componets one needs to make this CABLE:
.br
1) One (1) DB9 use solder type connector only.
.br
2) One (1) DB9/25F use solder type connector only.
.br
3) two (2) 4.7K ohm 1/4 watt %5 resistors.
.br
4) one (1) foot of 3/32" (inch) shrink wrap/boot.
.br
5) rosin core solder.
.br
6) three (3) to five (5) feet of 22AWG multi-stranded five
.br
   (5) conductor cable.
.LP
First solder both of the resistors into pin# (4) DB9 or (20) DB25 the DTR. 
This will be used as the Vcc pull-up voltage for testing the outputs on 
any "UPS by APC" ONLY in Simple Signal mode. This may not work on a 
BackUPS Pro if the default communications are Smart Signal mode. This 
cable is valid for "ShareUPS" BASIC Port mode if there are no other cables
that can be gotten.
.LP
Next bend each of the resistors so that one connects to (8) DB9 or (5) DB25 
the CTS (aka battery low signal) and the other to (2) DB9 or (3) DB25 the 
RxD (aka another line fail signal). This line is not currently used, but 
it will be in the near future.
.LP
(*) 8/5 is also wire to pin# 5 on UPS cable side.
.br
(*) 2/3 is also wire to pin# 3 on UPS cable side.
.br
(*) we use the DTR as our +5 volts power for the circuit.
.LP
If you have one of the following cables supplied by APCC,
.B apcupsd
will support off the shelf cables.
.br
940-0020B     Simple Signal Only, all models.
.br
940-0024[B/C/G]  SmartMode Only, SU, BPPro and BKPro only.
.br
940-0095[A/C]  PnP (Plug and Play), all models.
.br
940-0023A     Simple Signal UNIX, [BROKEN STILL].

.SH BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
.LP
Any other name will cause an error when loading the "/etc/apcupsd.conf"
file. There are some known problems and limitations. There can be a
problem with the newest types of APC Smart UPS add-ons. Any and All
Network Modes is not supported, yet. No bugs in standard stuff. I
am sure, well pretty sure. Possible bugs in all ShareUPS mode types.
If anyone has had success at all with any ShareUPS models, please report.
.SH EtherUPS/NetUPS
This is fully functional as of version 3.4.0.
