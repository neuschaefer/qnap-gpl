# ======== configuration parameters used during power failures ==========
#
# The ONBATTERYDELAY is the time in seconds from when a power failure
#   is detected until we react to it with an onbattery event.
#
#   This means that, apccontrol will be called with the powerout argument
#   immediately when a power failure is detected.  However, the
#   onbattery argument is passed to apccontrol only after the 
#   ONBATTERYDELAY time.  If you don't want to be annoyed by short
#   powerfailures, make sure that apccontrol powerout does nothing
#   i.e. comment out the wall.
ONBATTERYDELAY 6
# 
# Note: BATTERYLEVEL, MINUTES, and TIMEOUT work in conjunction, so
# the first that occurs will cause the initation of a shutdown.
#
# If during a power failure, the remaining battery percentage
# (as reported by the UPS) is below or equal to BATTERYLEVEL, 
# apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown.
BATTERYLEVEL 5
#
#
# If during a power failure, the remaining runtime in minutes 
# (as calculated internally by the UPS) is below or equal to MINUTES,
# apcupsd, will initiate a system shutdown.
MINUTES 3
#
#
# If during a power failure, the UPS has run on batteries for TIMEOUT
# many seconds or longer, apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown.
# A value of 0 disables this timer.
#
#  Note, if you have a Smart UPS, you will most likely want to disable
#    this timer by setting it to zero. That way, you UPS will continue
#    on batteries until either the % charge remaing drops to or below BATTERYLEVEL,
#    or the remaining battery runtime drops to or below MINUTES.  Of course,
#    if you are testing, setting this to 60 causes a quick system shutdown
#    if you pull the power plug.   
#  If you have an older dumb UPS, you will want to set this to less than
#    the time you know you can run on batteries.
TIMEOUT 0
#
#
#  Time in seconds between annoying users to signoff prior to
#  system shutdown. 0 disables.
ANNOY 300
#
# Initial delay after power failure before warning users to get
# off the system.
ANNOYDELAY 60
#
# The condition which determines when users are prevented from
# logging in during a power failure.
# NOLOGON <string> [ disable | timeout | percent | minutes | always ]
NOLOGON disable
#
#
# If killdelay is set, apcupsd will continue running after a
# shutdown has been requested, and after the specified time in
# seconds attempt to kill the power.  This is for use on systems
# where apcupsd cannot regain control after a shutdown.
# KILLDELAY <seconds>  0 disables
KILLDELAY 0
#
#
# ==== Configuration statements the network information server =========
#
# NETSERVER [ on | off ] on enables, off disables the network
#  information server. If netstatus is on, a network information
#  server process will be started for serving the STATUS and
#  EVENT data over the network (used by CGI programs).
NETSERVER on
#
# NISIP <dotted notation ip address>
#  IP address on which NIS server will listen for incoming connections.
#  Default value is 0.0.0.0 that means any incoming request will be
#  serviced but if you want it to listen to a single subnet you can
#  set it up to that subnet address, for example 192.168.10.0
#  Additionally you can listen for a single IP like 192.168.10.1
NISIP @NISIP@
#
# NISPORT <port> default is 3551 as registered with the IANA
#  port to use for sending STATUS and EVENTS data over the network.
#  It is not used unless NETSERVER is on. If you change this port,
#  you will need to change the corresponding value in the cgi directory
#  and rebuild the cgi programs.
NISPORT @NISPORT@
#
# If you want the last few EVENTS to be available over the network
# by the network information server, you must define an EVENTSFILE.
EVENTSFILE @LOGDIR@/apcupsd.events
#
# EVENTSFILEMAX <kilobytes>
#  By default, the size of the EVENTSFILE will be not be allowed to exceed
#  10 kilobytes.  When the file grows beyond this limit, older EVENTS will
#  be removed from the beginning of the file (first in first out).  The
#  parameter EVENTSFILEMAX can be set to a different kilobyte value, or set
#  to zero to allow the EVENTSFILE to grow without limit.
EVENTSFILEMAX 10

# ========== Configuration statements used if sharing =============
#            a UPS and controlling it via the network              
#
#      The configuration statements below are used if you
#      want to share one UPS to power multiple machines and have them
#      communicate by the network. Obviously, the master is connected
#      to the UPS via the serial cable, and it communicates to the
#      "slaves" via the network -- i.e. the slaves get their info
#      concerning the UPS via the ethernet.
#
# UPSCLASS [ standalone | shareslave | sharemaster | netslave | netmaster ]
# normally standalone unless you share a UPS with multiple machines.
UPSCLASS standalone
#
# Unless you want to share the UPS (power multiple machines).
#  this should be disable
# UPSMODE [ disable | share | net | sharenet ]

#
# ===== Configuration statements to control apcupsd system logging ========
#
# Time interval in seconds between writing the STATUS file; 0 disables
STATTIME 0
#
# Location of STATUS file (written to only if STATTIME is non-zero)
STATFILE @LOGDIR@/apcupsd.status
#
#
# LOGSTATS [ on | off ] on enables, off disables
# Note! This generates a lot of output, so if         
#       you turn this on, be sure that the
#       file defined in syslog.conf for LOG_NOTICE is a named pipe.
#  You probably do not want this on.
LOGSTATS off
#
#
# Time interval in seconds between writing the DATA records to
#   the log file. 0 disables.
DATATIME 0
#
# FACILITY defines the logging facility (class) for logging to syslog. 
#          If not specified, it defaults to "daemon". This is useful 
#          if you want to separate the data logged by apcupsd from other
#          programs.
#FACILITY DAEMON
