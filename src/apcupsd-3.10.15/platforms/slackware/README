The Slackware installation of apcupsd no longer replaces the /etc/rc.d/rc6
(halt) script, but rather attempts to patch it.  This should be more
portable across Slackware versions.  It has been tested with Slackware 7.

If the rc6 script appears to have been previously patched for apcupsd,
it will not be touched.  When it is patched, a copy of the rc6 script
will be saved in the /etc/rc.d; that copy will have a timestamp as a
suffix.

Once 'make install' has been run, there are still two steps which must
be carried out in order to complete the installation:

1.  You must create/edit the file apcupsd.conf file (by default, it
    belongs in the /etc/apcupsd directory).  Some examples of this file are
    given in the directories:
	contrib/apcupsdconf/cfgfiles
	examples
    The installation process will install a default one for you if you
    don't already have one from a previous version of apcupsd.

2.  Test your installation, as described in the apcupsd manual.  The
    rc.apcupsd script that should be used to start, stop, and obtain the
    status of the apcupsd daemon is located in /etc/rc.d.

3.  Once you are satisfied that the installation is sane, you need to
    configure your system to start apcupsd automatically.  The recommended
    way to do this is by adding the following lines to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local
    file:

	# Start the APC UPS control daemon.
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.apcupsd ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.apcupsd start
	fi

If you are running a version of Slackware earlier than v7 bring up X on
boot, it is *possible* that rc.local is not being executed.  You should
verify whether or not this is the case and take appropriate remedial
action.  If there is reference to rc.local in the rc.M script, then you
are probably safe.

If you are using the network feature (master-slave) of apcupsd and are
running a DNS server locally, make sure the name server is up and running
before executing rc.apcupsd.  Since named is normally started out of
rc.inet2, this should be a non-issue.



The deinstallation process ('make uninstall') will attempt to unpatch your
rc6.d script.  If it fails (which may happen if you have since edited that
file), then you can manually remove references to apcupsd or just leave it
as is; without apcupsd running, the patch is benign.

The deinstallation process will not modify rc.local.
