I have modified the scripts by Russell Kroll that work with his upstools
suite to suit the apcupsd available at:
http://www.dyer.vanderbilt.edu/server/apcupsd/

I've also added various features (see below).

 - upsstats.cgi: Generates the HTML for the main status page.

 - upsimage.cgi: Called by IMG SRC tags in status pages.
       
       Features: (original)
                 * Text output of various stats & 3 graphs
                         * Battery Capacity 
                         * Utility Voltage
                         * UPS Load
                 * Handles 110V UPS only
                 (added)
                 * 2 more graphs
                         * Battery Voltage
                         * Output Voltage
                 * Ability to select each graph
                 * Ability to change temperature reading (deg C/F/K)
                 * Should now handle 110/230V UPS (110V untested)
                 * Automatic refresh every 30 secs
                 * Random number added to end of IMG cgi call to
                   ensure images are NOT cached


OK, assuming you have configured and installed the program already, here
is how you actually use it to keep an eye on things.

============
= upsstats =
============

upsstats is a CGI program, and as such, you must invoke it through your
web server with a browser.  Assuming you have it installed into your
/cgi-bin directory, accessing the following URL will allow you to see
what's going on in your UPS..

http://your.machine.dom/cgi-bin/upsstats.cgi

Making a bookmark to this script or linking to it from another page is an 
easy way to return to it in the future.

To change any of the graphs just pick your option from the pull down menu.
The same goes for the temperature display.

============
= upsimage =
============

upsimage is also a CGI program like upsstats, but it is intended to be
called by IMG SRC requests inside the page that upsstats generates.
You can source the images from it directly if you like, but they may
look rather odd outside the table scheme of the normal upsstats page.
Most users will probably never need to touch upsimage directly.


===============
= Other Notes =
===============

upsimage uses the gd library from http://www.boutell.com/ for quick 
generation of GIF images.  If you have something that needs speedy 
graphical representations of data that's being written in C, you should 
check it out.
