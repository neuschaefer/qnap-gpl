- after exiting from ncurses mode, the contents of the screen are not always
  restored--other programs have this problem too:
  			aumix	alpine	lynx	mc	mutt	vim
  Linux VGA console	failure	failure failure failure	failure	failure
  Linux xterm		success success	success	success	success	success
  FreeBSD syscons	failure	failure	failure	success	failure	failure
  FreeBSD xterm		failure	failure	failure	failure	failure	failure
- when the sound driver supports only a single recording source, aumix may use
  an incorrect ioctl (Debian bug 116396, reported by Antonio Arauzo--see
  <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=116396>--unconfirmed)
- when using the GTK+ interface, if no sound driver is loaded, no error message
  is printed (Debian bug 170370, reported by Jan Minaarz--see
  <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=170370>--confirmed by
  Trevor Johnson)
- suspending with ^Z may make the terminal difficult to use
- most translations need to be updated
- on the PC, program exits from ncurses mode when it receives strange keyboard
  input such as Alt- combinations
- ncurses display is not correct on very narrow terminals (22 columns or fewer)
- in an xterm, screen may not always be redrawn properly when it is resized
- some options only work when given in a particular order
- "-f -" does not load settings from stdin
- balance controls can get stuck when adjusted from the keyboard
- Christian Weisgerber reports "aumix dies with malloc() complaining about a
  recursive call"
- configure --help doesn't mention --without-gpm or --without-sysmouse
- Greg Louis reports problems with "make install" on Linux with libc5 when GNU
  gettext is not installed:
   /bin/sh: --default-domain=aumix: command not found
   make[1]: *** [aumix.pot] Error 127
   make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/aumix-2.1/po'
   make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
  This error also appears on FreeBSD with gettext installed, when building
  with --disable-nls and no patches applied (not using the port).
- GNU make is still needed for "clean" and "distclean" targets, and for
  generating po/aumix.pot
- generation of intl/po2tbl.sed (which generates po/cat-id-tbl.c) is broken
