This is a maintenance release. Several bugs have been corrected,
but no significant new features have been added. The configure
script no longer takes options for GTK+ 1.2, nor for the non-existent
ALSA support. The build system now works with recent autotools. The
new shortcut key "0" sets maximum level or extreme right balance
(as "]" long has).

Thanks to Stefan Ott for helping with the preparation of this
release.
