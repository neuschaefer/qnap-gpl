* add msgctxt (context) lines, available with gettext 0.15 and later, to ease
  translation
* when controls are hidden through the View menu, keep track of this in the rc

  <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=71995>)
* integrate ReadWriteMixer() into LoadSettings() and SaveSettings()
* translate man pages
* long options
* add key bindings besides cursor keys for changing mixer channels
* remove redundant key bindings
* add ability to set SOUND_MIXER_3DSE and SOUND_MIXER_AGC (for Linux but not
  FreeBSD--see the sb_mixer.c file that comes with the source for the Linux
  kernel,
  <URL:http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9906.0/1160.html> and
  <URL:http://studwww.rug.ac.be/~fcorneli/g3dse/>)
* use native API on NetBSD and OpenBSD
* add support for ALSA
* add "load from" and "save to" functions to ncurses interface
* add ability to load settings from stdin and output them to stdout
* add support for SMPTE time codes
* add a recording mode which puts "wait" lines into the generated rc file
* try to detect multiple mixer devices, and offer a way to adjust them
* find out how to display Chinese text in GTK--probably something
  like "install GB2312 fonts, edit the fontset section of your ~/.gtkrc,
  and set LANG to zh_CN.GB2312"--and add to INSTALL
