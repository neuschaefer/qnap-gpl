First of all, please help us make CenterIM version 5 a better client. It's a complete rewrite based on
libpurple and it's aim is to have a working client with the nice centerim UI. You can find information
here http://www.centerim.org/index.php/Cim-5 and http://www.centerim.org/index.php/Cim5-Architecture

have you ever used a jabber server with additional transports/agents?
centerim behaves a bit "strange" when dealing with transport/agent contacts
maybe you can just try using the jabber.ccc.de transports for AIM and ICQ with psi
and then with centerim
also, centerim doesn't even support service discovery and transport functions (like registration, logon/logoff etc.)
so at first you *have to* use psi to register for such a transport
and then you can use the jabber account with centerim
the gateways will appear as normal contacts
but if you try to move them to a group for example, that doesn't "survive" a reconnect
more, the contact appears duplicated
everytime you reconnect
same goes for the server contact itself

[ registration ]
it doesn't allow me to change that
I guess it doesn't query for such transports.
but only for user directories
this is what happens in Psi when I run the service discovery:

and this is what happens in centerim when I go to the "update user details" screen

it only queries the vcard
and btw, this is what happens when I leave the vcard-screen without changing anything:

+ [jab] error 501

the server is jabberd2
you can test with jabber.ccc.de or with my own
if you wish, I can create you an account there
maybe you can try both, as jabber.ccc.de is jabberd1.4 with different transports
so those are 2 completely different setups -- maybe good test scenarios

so, just tell me and I will create an account for you. public registration is
disabled on my server, that's the reason you cannot register one using
centerim.

something else I've noticed
when using centerim and Psi simultaneously for one jabber account
when I delete a contact in centerim, Psi notices on the fly and the contact disappears from psi's list
when I do it the other way round centerim notices nothing :)

antispam to block auth events too

utf8

jabber services bugs from wolfram
    contact items duplication

update users details -> accept -> error

gaim gpg plugin for other IM networks

icq invisibility scanner

a nice feature would be to be able to add a custom away-message
when using centerim -S a -p icq

external status event (notification on changing status)

icq file transfers

multiple history selection

LJ records modification

don't completely overwrite config files

mark deleted LJ friends somehow

XML console

msn file transfers

msn other users' joins to the conversation

icq keywords + other parameters simultaneous search

icq haspicture flag

file insert key

Also..you have any command line for change the random group where I
appear and send the change to ICQ servers?

specific status lists for every protocol, extend the standard statuses

stupid conversation logs
