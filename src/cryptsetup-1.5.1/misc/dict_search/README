Simple example how to use libcryptsetup
for password search.

Run: luks_dict <device|image> <dictionary> [cpus]

<device|image> is LUKS device or image
<dictionary> is list of passphrases to try
(note trailing EOL is stripped)

cpus - number of processes to start in parallel

Format of dictionary file is simple one password per line,
if first char on line s # it is skiped as comment.

You have it run as root (device-mapper cannot
create dmcrypt devices as nrmal user. Code need
to map keyslots as temporary dmcrypt device.)
