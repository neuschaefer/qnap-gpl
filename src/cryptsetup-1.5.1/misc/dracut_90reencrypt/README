Example of simple dracut module for reencryption of system
LUKS drive on-the-fly.

Install in /usr/[share|lib]/dracut/modules.d/90reencrypt, then
rebuild intramfs "with dracut -f -a reencrypt".

Dracut then recognize argument rd_REENCRYPT=name:size,
e.g. rd_REENCRYPT=sda2:52G means only 52G of device
will be reencrypted (default is whole device).
(Name is kernel name of device.)

Note that reencryption context is stored in ramdisk, any
fail can mean complete lost of data!
