LGPLv2+ DHCPv6 implementation
http://fedorahosted.org/dhcpv6/
-------------------------------

DHCPv6 is a stateful address autoconfiguration protocol for IPv6, a
counterpart to IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration protocol.  It can
either be used independently or it can coexist with its counterpart protocol.
This protocol uses client/server mode of operation but can also provide
support through a Relay Agent.

This protocol is intended to support on IPv6 based networks only.  For
specific details of the protocol, refer to the specification available from
the IETF.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a protocol conformant
implementation for Linux and other Unix operating systems.
