README for mini editor e3 release 2.7.1

(c) GPL 2000-07 Albrecht Kleine  
kleine@ak.sax.de  


1. OVERVIEW
===========
e3 is a micro text editor with an executable code size between 
3800 and 35000 bytes, depending on used assembler options,
platform and self compressor.
Except for 'syntax highlighting', the e3 binary supports all of the basic
functions one expects plus built in arithmetic calculations. If you have 
installed the stream editor 'sed' you can use these tools as sub-processes,
getting the full power of regular expressions.

e3 can use Wordstar-, EMACS-, Pico, Nedit or vi-like key bindings,
whichever the user chooses.
Also the user can calculate arithmetics inside the text.

e3's assembler version is available on 9 important OS,
using 16/32/64 bit CPUs:
	* Linux kernels 2.x
	  (from 16 bit ELKS via 32 bit x86 up to AMD64,
	   plus ARM-linux kernel 2.4 @zaurus PDA)
	* FreeBSD 2.x-5.x
	* OpenBSD 3.4,
	* NetBSD 1.6,2.0
	* BeOS 5PE
	* Win98
	* QNX RTP 6.1
	* Atheos 0.3.7
	* FreeDOS kernel 1.1.24

There is also a GNU-C-written version for non-i386-Unix
and non-ARM-Linux platforms (e3.c) using Wordstar keybindings only.
This README doesn't further mention e3.c. (Just make it!)

e3 is designed to be INDEPENDENT OF LIBC OR ANY OTHER library,
except on QNX and Win32.

It's been tested using the terminal console, but Xterm, Eterm,
kvt, rxvt, vt220 and vt100 should work too. 

Beginning in version 2.6.0 e3 does support UTF-8 coding of unicode
characters like this: α   ( <---should be a greek alpha )




2a. BUILD on Linux/FreeBSD/NetBSD/BeOS/QNX/Atheos (32 bit)
==========================================================
A. For assembling of e3 you need NASM assembler release nasm-0.99.05 

B. If you don't like the default OS or destination (LINUX , /usr/local/ )
   then edit top of Makefile 
   (other possible OS are FreeBSD or BEOS or QNX or ATHEOS).
   
C. e3 is expecting "sed" at /bin/sed, or "ex" at /usr/bin/ex; otherwise change 
   SEDPATH in e3.asm.  By default /bin/sed is used, but you can
   use /usr/bin/ex instead, if you edit Makefile as appropriate.
   (NOT available for BeOS,QNX,Atheos)

D. Build e3 via typing 'make' (or 'gmake' on FreeBSD)  for building:             
   e3	: the default Wordstar-like version,
   e3ws	: ditto Wordstar,
   e3em	: the Emacs-like version,
   e3pi	: the Pico-like version,
   e3vi	: the vi-like version.
   e3ne	: the Nedit-like version.
   (e3?? are symbolic links to e3. In fact only one executable is built.)

E. Optional: type 'make install' or 
   move or copy e3 and its symlinks wherever you want.

F. Optional: some more editable options are on top of e3.h: 
   for example, if you don't like WS mode, choice an other default mode 
   by setting DEFAULT_MODE to one of EM, NE, PI or VI .
   Also you could activate error beeping in vi mode by uncommenting 
   the BEEP_IN_VI line.
   

2b. BUILD on Linux (64 bit)
===========================
A. For assembling of e3 you need YASM or NASM assembler,
   e.g.  yasm 0.6.99.2005 
   or NASM version 0.99.05

B. see 2a, except for make, this should be:
   make yasm64
   or
   make nasm64



2c. BUILD on Win9x / ME / DOS
=============================
A. For assembling of e3 you need  NASM assembler nasm-0.99.05 
   and ALINK (Anthony's Linker) and Win32 Import Library (win32.lib)
   Both are available for free on the net.

B. Type 'make' , i.e. run make.bat, and move e3.exe, e3-16.com 
   and e3*.bat wherever you want.

C. Optional: some more editable options are on top of e3.h: 
   for example, if you don't like WS mode, choice an other default mode 
   by setting DEFAULT_MODE to one of EM, NE, PI or VI . In this
   case you would not need to call one of the batches to run
   your favourite mode.


2d. BUILD on OpenBSD
====================
Here is a Makefile for BSD-make included. See ./bin directory.
Also you need current NASM (nasm-0.99.05)
In general you don't need to change that file.


2e. BUILD for ELKS
==================
This is done usual on 32 bit x86 Linux systems either
by typing "make elks" or changing to elks/ and typing "make".
You need to have installed the ld86 linker (part of dev86 suite).


2f. BUILD for ARM Linux
=======================
Simply type "make armlinux" on your x86 box.
You will need the ARM linux toolchain, at least
	arm-linux-as: GNU assembler 2.11.2
	arm-linux-ld: GNU ld 2.11.2
Fetch it via:
	ftp://ftp.armlinux.org/pub/toolchain
Or adjust 'Makefile' and build e3arm on the destination ARM box.




3. RELEASE NOTES
================

FINAL RELEASE with some adjustments for supporting current 
NASM and YASM assemblers both supporting  for 32/64 bit.
So now on LINUX(x86) beside
	make
	make yasm
	make yasm64
you have the NEW make destinations
	make nasm64
	make nasm32	(<- same as pure 'make')

Please don't try old NASMs or YASMs. It won't work.

Except Linux (16/32/64 bit) no more binaries are included.



4. BASIC USAGE
==============
* All versions of e3 accept a filename as argument; see the man page.

* There is a status and input line, where you can enter filenames, 
  find-texts, line numbers  etc.  In the lower right corner you will find
  a code like "WS" showing the selected editor mode and a help
  pointer (EXCEPT vi).

* e3 changes the appearance of the cursor (to reverse) depending on 
  insert/overwrite mode (on Linux text console only). 

* For details on key bindings read each e3xx's initial page or 
  type Alt-H during edit (for vi use  ESC:h). 
  
* On some computers (BeOS, QNX etc.) Alt-key combinations won't work: 
  press <ESC> followed by the key, e.g. press ESC and H instead of Alt-H.

* e3 shows a dot for characters below ASCII 20h and greater 7Fh
  (except on win9x and except on UTF-8 version).

* At the end of an edit cycle, e3 asks you something like "SAVE? Ynl".  Press
  "n" to NOT save, "l" for SAVE and LOAD new, any other for SAVE and EXIT.


5. ARITHMETICS
==============
You can do some simple arithmetic calculations inside your text. 
For example:
                 1234+56*78=
place cursor here^ and press one of:

   ^KN  for WSTAR mode
   ^QC  for PICO mode
   ^X^N for EMACS mode
   #    for VI command mode
   ^K   for NEDIT mode
This should insert the result of 5602 into text.


Use values -999999999999.999999 ... -0.000001, 0, 0.000001 up to
999999999999.999999  and operators +-*/ and ( ) .

Some more examples:
 2+4*8=34
 2/3*3=2
 -4*-3--5*-4=-8
 4-3--4-3=2
 -5*-(13+-2*(3+4))+2=-3
 (7*(((((6+2+(((((1)))))))))))=63
 (13120-9972)/9972=0.315684
 100000000+0.000001=100000000.000001
 10000000000+1=10000000001
 1+1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10=3628801
 7.627891*2.643189=20.161958
 10000000000/8=1250000000

Some problems:
 100000000000+1.00001=99999997953.00001	<--loss of precision!
 8/0=					<--not possible. You know.
 					   (e3 says "beep")
 100000000*100000000=			<--overflow 

Two specials: 
 12*p=37.699112				<--p is PI 3.14.....
 r+20=57.699112				<--r is result of last calculation
 
This arithmetic calculator is the smallest and simplest I could write.
It takes only some hundred byte in the executable because it does NOT use 
precise BCD arithmetics, but built in x87-coprocessor features. So please 
do NOT expect very high precision. 



6. MIXED HINTS
==============
* The emacs-mode version has currently a kill buffer but no kill ring,
  so be careful about that. I'm sure, inside some 1000 byte you won't 
  expect a complete Emacs key set, but IMHO you get the most important part.

* The Pico mode is both: extended and incomplete compared to some Pico options,
  new are some ^J (delete) and ^Q (quick_move) keys.

* The win9x version does no accept any filename on the command line if this 
  filename contains blank spaces.

* The size of files you edit is currently limited to the maximum of either 
  1024k or twice the file's size if you start with a file on command line, i.e.,
  for example, starting e3 with a 2MB_sized_file gives you another 2 MB space 
  for inserts.

* You can choose inside the edit session (w/o leaving e3) between the 
  different edit modes, for example:
	-start  e3em <filename>
		---> now using Emacs style keys.
	-type   altX
	-type	e3vi
		---> welcome in the land of vi!
	-type   <ESC>;
	-type   e3ws
		---> you are entering Wordstar emulation sector!
	....etc....
  This VERY hot keys are ^KM (for WS), ^QM (for Pico), altX (for Emacs),
  ^E (for Nedit) and <ESC>; (for vi-mode).
  
  Note: on some computers press ESC X instead of altX.

* Everytime if e3vi does not recognize a vi-mode ex command, e3vi will pipe
  the whole editor text buffer through /bin/sed or /bin/ex. I.e. you can use 
  pure sed or ex commands like:
	1,6 s/foo/bar/
	2,$ d
	8,$ w filecopy
	/remove_me/d
  ***TAKE CARE***: "sed" or "ex" won't know your current cursor position in e3!
  What call to subprogram (either ex or sed) is compiled in
  you can find in helptext:
	"pipe buffer through /bin/sed"    
	vs.    
	"pipe buffer through /bin/ex"
  You should know this because the syntax is not equal:
	s/./\./		<--sed syntax
	1,$ s/./\./g	<-- ex syntax
  Also you should know what "sed" version you have installed,
  because sed 2.x and sed 3.x are quite different.
  You can use this new buffer pipe features also from WS-, Pico- and Emacs modes
  by pressing ^KP (Wordstar), or ^JP (Pico), or ^X^P (Emacs).

* There is no predefined UNDO level count. You can expect to UNDO at least
  one last insert-, delete-, overwrite- or sed_pipe-operation, but in most 
  cases there are lots of UNDO stages available.  e3 has a fixed size undo buffer
  and will use an external helper file if some deleted data is bigger sized 
  than the undo buffer. This buffer is organized as a ring, overwriting 
  older UNDO information if neccessary. So one never can say exactly 
  how many UNDO operations are possible. 
  For using the UNDO press one of:
   ^U   for WSTAR mode
   ^QU  for PICO mode
   ^_   for EMACS mode
   u    for VI command mode
   ^U   for NEDIT mode



7. Notes on UTF-8 for the  Linux/ASM-version
============================================

* By default now e3 does does support UTF-8 coding of unicode
  characters like this: α  (should be a greek alpha).

* You could disable UTF-8 support in e3 by editing e3.h at line 16:
  from
  %define UTF8
  to
  ;;; %define UTF8
  and run 'make' again.
  
* Running e3_with_disabled_UTF-support at a UTF-8 console 
  you will see two points .. for UTF-8 characters e.g. the greek alpha.

* If your terminal does _not_ support UTF-8 it is strongly 
  recommended to _disable_ UTF8-support in e3.h, 
  because output of some characters could be scrambled.

* e3 will _not_ convert your files from/to UTF-8 coding.
  It does simply _use_ your terminal encodings. 

* UTF-8 characters like © (c) will look very false on non-UTF-8 terminals,
  but e3 can't help here. (So at first use a file converter.)

* If you simply call e3 without file argument the initial screen of e3 
  will tell you whether UTF8-support is built in:

  MicroEditor e3 v2.7.0-UTF8 ©2000-06
  vs.
  MicroEditor e3 v2.7.0 (C)2000-06

* If it is a version with UTF8 and you are running
  e3 in an UTF8 terminal, you can switch the editor
  from UTF-8 mode to 7 bit mode and back. 
  Use the special keys:
	^KU in WS mode
	^QV in Pico mode
	^Y in Nedit mode
	^U  in Emacs mode
	ESC:u  in vi mode
