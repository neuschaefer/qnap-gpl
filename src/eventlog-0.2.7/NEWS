	The order of tags is reversed. Previously eventlog generated
        messages with the tag ordering opposite of what the application

	Sat, 03 Dec 2005 11:09:40 +0100

	A proper release in a long time, syslog-ng itself relied on the

	ChangeLog is generated automatically based on tla commits.

	Added two implementations of the syslog wrapper (macro and dlsym
	based).

	The dlsym() based can be enabled by configure-ing with the
	--enable-dlsym-wrapper option.

	The macro based can be used by defining the symbol
	EVENTLOG_SYSLOG_MACROS preprocessor symbol prior to including
	evtlog.h.

	Tue,  7 Jan 2003 20:11:13 +0100

	file

	Mon,  6 Jan 2003 17:09:58 +0100
