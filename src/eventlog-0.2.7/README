The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the simple syslog() API
provided on UNIX systems. The major difference between EventLog and syslog
is that EventLog tries to add structure to messages.

Where you had a simple non-structrured string in syslog() you have a
combination of description and tag/value pairs.

EventLog provides an interface to build, format and output an event record.
The exact format and output method can be customized by the administrator
via a configuration file.

Installation
------------

Installing this library is quite straightforward as it does not depend on
anything but libc.

First grab your copy of the library. It is a tarball named
eventlog-x.x.x.x.tar.gz where x.x.x.x is the library revision.

tar xvfz eventlog-x.x.x.x.tar.gz
cd eventlog-x.x.x.x
./configure
make && make install

If you want to package the library or move the binaries to another system,
you can use the DESTDIR argument to 'make install' like this:

make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging install

which will use the /tmp/staging directory as root and copy all files beneath
as it were a real system.
