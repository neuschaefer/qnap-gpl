Configuration
-------------

The library contains a very cruft configuration file parser which reads
/etc/eventlog.conf. Each line in this file is in the form of:

keyword		value

The following keywords are defined:

* format: specifies which formatter to use (currently implemented: plain, xmlattr, xmltag)
* outmethod: specifies which output method to use (currently implemented: local)
