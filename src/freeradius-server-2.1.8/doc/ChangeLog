FreeRADIUS 2.1.8 Wed 30 Dec 16:44:50 CEST 2009, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements

	  in debugging mode.

	  if they were read from a different detail file.

	  socket.  You need to set "broadcast = yes" in the DHCP listener.
	* Be more restrictive on string parsing in the config files
	* Fix password length in scripts/create-users.pl
	* Be more flexible about parsing the detail file.  This allows
	  it to read files where the attributes have been edited.
	* Ensure that requests read from the detail file are cleaned up
	  (i.e. don't leak) if they are proxied without a response.
	* Write the PID file after opening sockets, not before
	  (closes bug #29)
	* Proxying large numbers of packets no longer gives error
	  "unable to open proxy socket".

	* Retry packet from detail file if there was no response.
	* Allow old-style dictionary formats, where the vendor name is the
	  last field in an ATTRIBUTE definition.

	  cleanup on some platforms.
	* Copy the EAP username verbatim, rather than escaping it.

	* Log reasons for EAP failure (closes bug #8)
	* Load home servers and pools that aren't referenced from a realm.

	* Added configurable "retry_interval" and "poll_interval"

	* Added experimental rlm_ruby from
	  http://github.com/Antti/freeradius-server/tree/master
	* Add Tunnel attributes to ldap.attrmap
	* Enable virtual servers to be reloaded on HUP.  For now, only
	  the "authorize", "authenticate", etc. processing sections are
	  reloaded.  Clients and "listen" sections are NOT reloaded.
	* Updated "radwatch" script to be more robust.  See scripts/radwatch
	* Added certificate compatibility notes in raddb/certs/README,
	  for compatibility with different operating systems. (i.e. Windows)

	* Minor fixes from John Center
	* Fixed raddebug example
	* Don't crash when deleting attributes via unlang
	* Be friendlier to very fast clients

	* Did autoconf magic to work around weird libtool bug
	* Make rlm_perl keep tags for tagged attributes in more situations

	  create control sockets owned by root.
	* Fixed more minor issues found by Coverity.
	* Allow raddb/certs/bootstrap to run when there is no "make"
	  command installed.
	* In radiusd.conf, run_dir depends on the name of the program,

	* Check for EOF in more places in the "detail" file reader.
	* Added Freeswitch dictionary.

	* Fix EAP-TLS bug.  Patch from Arnaud Ebalard

	  platforms.
	* Correct internal handling of "debug condition" to prevent it
	  from being over-written.
	* Check return code of regcomp in "unlang", so that invalid
	  regular expressions are caught rather than mishandled.
	* Make rlm_sql use <ltdl.h>.  Addresses bug #610.
	* Document list "type = status" better.  Closes bug #580.

	  can go to the log file, and not stdout.
	* Added dictionary.rfc5176
	* EAP module now checks for instance name, and uses that for

	  This is available only debug builds.  It can be used
	  to create invalid packets! Use it with care.
	* Permit "unlang" policies inside of Auth-Type{} sub-sections
	  of the authenticate{} section.  This makes some policies easier
	  to implement.

	* radrelay functionality is now included in the server core.
	  See raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
