#  "passwd" configuration, for the /etc/group file. Adds a Etc-Group-Name
#  attribute for every group that the user is member of.
#
#  You will have to define the Etc-Group-Name in the 'dictionary' file
#  as a 'string' type.
#
#  The Group-Name attribute is automatically created by the Unix module,
#  and does checking against /etc/group automatically.
#
#  i.e. this module should NOT be used as-is, but should be edited to
#  point to a different group file.
