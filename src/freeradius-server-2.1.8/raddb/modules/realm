# Realm module, for proxying.
#
#  You can have multiple instances of the realm module to
#  support multiple realm syntaxs at the same time.  The
#  search order is defined by the order that the modules are listed
#  in the authorize and preacct sections.
#
#  Four config options:
#	format         -  must be "prefix" or "suffix"
#			  The special cases of "DEFAULT"
#			  and "NULL" are allowed, too.
#	delimiter      -  must be a single character

#  'realm/username'
#
#  Using this entry, IPASS users have their realm set to "IPASS".
realm IPASS {
	format = prefix
	delimiter = "/"
}

#  'username@realm'
#
realm suffix {
	format = suffix
	delimiter = "@"
}

#  'username%realm'
#
realm realmpercent {
	format = suffix
	delimiter = "%"
}

#
#  'domain\user'
#
realm ntdomain {
	format = prefix
	delimiter = "\\"
}
