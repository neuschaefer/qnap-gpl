GD 1.8.4_patch

This is a patched version of Tom Boutell's GD library version 1.8.4.
It uses the GNU Autoconfig system to make it easier to compile libgd
as a shared library, as well as to locate the correct link libraries.
Compiling libgd as a shared library will make it easier to run the
Perl GD interface in some cases.

Please see INSTALL and readme.txt for full instructions.

other questions relating to libgd should be directed to Tom Boutell
