.TH GPGV 1 2019-11-20 "GnuPG 1.4.7" "GNU Privacy Guard"
.SH NAME
.B gpgv
\- Verify OpenPGP signatures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B  gpgv
.RI [ options ]
.I signed_files




.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgpgv\fR is an OpenPGP signature verification tool.

This program is actually a stripped down version of \fBgpg\fR which is
only able to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully blown
\fBgpg\fR and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that
the public keys used to make the signature are valid. There are
no configuration files and only a few options are implemented.

\fBgpgv\fR assumes that all keys in the keyring are trustworthy.
By default it uses a keyring named `\fItrustedkeys.gpg\fR' which is
assumed to be in the home directory as defined by GnuPG or set by an
option or an environment variable. An option may be used to specify
another keyring or even multiple keyrings.


.SH RETURN VALUE

The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least
one signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBgpgv\fR recognizes these options:


.TP
.B  --verbose
.TP
.B  -v
Gives more information during processing. If used
twice, the input data is listed in detail.

.TP
.B  --quiet
.TP
.B  -q
Try to be as quiet as possible.

.TP
.B  --keyring \fIfile\fR
Add \fIfile\fR to the list of keyrings.
If \fIfile\fR begins with a tilde and a slash, these
are replaced by the HOME directory. If the filename
does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the
home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not used).

.TP
.B  --status-fd \fIn\fR
Write special status strings to the file descriptor \fIn\fR.  See the
file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them.

.TP
.B  --logger-fd \fBn\fR
Write log output to file descriptor \fBn\fR and not to stderr.

.TP
.B  --ignore-time-conflict
GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and
signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature seems to
be older than the key due to clock problems. This option turns these
checks into warnings.

.TP
.B  --homedir \fIdir\fR
Set the name of the home directory to \fIdir\fR. If his option is not
used, the home directory defaults to `\fI~/.gnupg\fR'.  It is only
recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
directory stated through the environment variable `\fIGNUPGHOME\fR' or
(on W32 systems) by means on the Registry entry
\fIHKCU\\Software\\GNU\\GnuPG:HomeDir\fR.


.SH EXAMPLES


.TP
.B  gpgv \fBpgpfile\fR
.TP
.B  gpgv \fBsigfile\fR 
Verify the signature of the file. The second form
is used for detached signatures, where \fBsigfile\fR is the detached
signature (either ASCII armored or binary) and are the signed
data; if this is not given the name of the file holding the signed data is
constructed by cutting off the extension (".asc", ".sig" or ".sign") from
\fBsigfile\fR.


.SH FILES


.TP
.B  ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg
The default keyring with the allowed keys


.SH ENVIRONMENT


.TP
.B  HOME
Used to locate the default home directory.

.TP
.B  GNUPGHOME
If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".
