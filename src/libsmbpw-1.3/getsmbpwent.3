.TH GETSMBPWENT 3  "Oct 12, 1999" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getsmbpwent, setsmbpwent, endsmbpwent \- get SMB password file entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "smbpwd.h"
.sp
.B struct smb_passwd *getsmbpwent(void);
.sp
.B void setsmbpwent(void);
.sp
.B void endsmbpwent(void);
.sp
.B void setsmbfilepath(char *path);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The smbpasswd file holds the encrypted password and account
information used by the SAMBA SMB file services daemon.

The \fBgetsmbpwent()\fP function returns a pointer to a structure containing
the broken out fields of a line from the smbpasswd file.  The first time it 
is called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns successive 
entries. Any lines that are empty or start with the '#' comment character
will be skipped. getsmbpwent will perform the necessary decoding for those 
fields in the smb_passwd structure that need binary to ascii conversion. 
.PP
The \fBsetpwent()\fP function rewinds the file pointer to the beginning 
of the smbpasswd file.
.PP
The \fBendpwent()\fP function closes the smbpasswd file.
.PP
The path to the smbpasswd file is set by calling \fBsetsmbfilepath()\fP,
as there are many places that the smbpasswd file can be found. If 
you do not call setsmbfilepath with the location of your smbpasswd
file, for example;
.nf
.sp
.B /etc/smbpasswd (under RedHat Linux)
.B /usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd (Standard Samba Dist)
.B or whatever path you put in your smb.conf file.
.sp
.fi
then the default (RedHat) path of /etc/smbpasswd will be tried. You need
to call setsmbfilepath() before any call to getsmbpwent().
.PP
The \fIsmb_passwd\fP structure is defined in \fI"smbpwd.h"\fP as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ta 8n 16n 32n
  struct smb_passwd
   {
     uid_t smb_userid;     /* this is actually the unix uid_t */
     char *smb_name;       /* username string */
     unsigned char *smb_passwd;    /* Null if no password */
     unsigned char *smb_nt_passwd; /* Null if no password */
     unsigned short int smb_acct_ctrl; /* account info (ACB_xxxx bit-mask) */
     time_t smb_pwlst;    /* password last set time */
     char *smb_gecos;     /* realname */
  }; 
.ta
.fi
.sp
You are responsible for maintaining the password last set time. The 
ACB_XXX bitmasks are defined in smbpwd.h.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBgetsmbpwent()\fP function returns the \fIsmb_passwd\fP structure, or NULL if 
there are no more entries or an error occurs.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory to parse smbpasswd file line. 
.SH FILES
.TP
.I smbpasswd
SMB password database file
