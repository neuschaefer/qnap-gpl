GNU libc 2.2.5 contains a bug which causes mutt to crash while libtrash is
running. Until a new GNU libc version is released, you can

(i) recompile GNU libc, after applying the included patch
(patch-glibc-2.2.5.diff);

(ii) completely disable libtrash when starting mutt ("LD_PRELOAD="" mutt");

(iii) use another MUA.

Again, strange as it may seem, this *isn't* a bug in libtrash: it is a bug
in GNU libc which shows up when you use libtrash.
