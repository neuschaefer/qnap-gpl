cleanTrash is a very helpful Perl script kindly provided by Daniel Sadilek.
Please take a look at the top of the script and modify any incorrect values
in the section titled "CONFIGURATION".

This script is meant to be run by root on a regular basis. It allows you to
set a maximum trash can size (in kilo-bytes), and whenever a user's trash
can exceeds that value the oldest files in that trash can will be
permanently deleted. cleanTrash can be run while libtrash is active for the
root account, even if it is configured in such a way that would normally
prevent root from deleting files in the users' directories: cleanTrash
bypasses libtrash when unlinking files from a user's trash can.

It might be a good idea to run it from a cron job.

The file ct2.pl contains an alternative implementation of cleanTrash, which
was kindly contributed by Martin Corley. It is meant to "rely less on
external processes, and use cleaner perl" (taken from the header of the
file). There is also a "CONFIGURATION" section for you to edit, and when
called it accepts one optional argument, "-Q", which makes ct2.pl operate
quietly.

A third alternative was recently written by Frederic Connes and is called
strash. It doesn't require perl and you can find it in the strash-0.9.tar.gz
tarball.
