This section lists known issues and bugs and gives some information on
how to submit bug reports.

@section bugs_unreadable Content is Unreadable. Open and Repair

Very occasionally you may encounter a bug which generates an Excel
warning when opening an `libxlsxwriter` file like:

> Excel could not open file.xlsx because some content is unreadable. Do
> you want to open and repair this workbook.

This ominous sounding message is Excel's standard warning for any validation
error in the XML used for the components of the XLSX file.

If you encounter an issue like this you should open an issue on GitHub with a
program to replicate the issue (see below).

@section bugs_formula_name Formulas displayed as 'NAME?' until edited

Excel 2010 and 2013 added functions which weren't defined in the original file
specification. These functions are referred to as *future* functions. Examples
of these functions are `ACOT`, `CHISQ.DIST.RT` , `CONFIDENCE.NORM`, `STDEV.P`,
`STDEV.S` and `WORKDAY.INTL`. The full list is given in the
[MS XLSX extensions documentation on future functions]
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd907480%28v=office.12%29.aspx).

When written using `write_formula()` these functions need to be fully
qualified with the `_xlfn.` prefix as they are shown in the MS XLSX
documentation link above. For example:

@code
    worksheet_write_formula(worksheet, 0, 0,"=_xlfn.STDEV.S(B1:B10)", NULL);
@endcode

See also @ref working_with_formulas.

@section bugs_formula_zero Formula results displaying as zero in non-Excel applications

Due to wide range of possible formulas and inter-dependencies between them,
`xlsxwriter` doesn't, and realistically cannot, calculate the result of a
formula when it is written to an XLSX file. Instead, it stores the value 0 as
the formula result. It then sets a global flag in the XLSX file to say that
all formulas and functions should be recalculated when the file is opened.

This is the method recommended in the Excel documentation and in general it
works fine with spreadsheet applications. However, applications that don't
have a facility to calculate formulas, such as Excel Viewer, or several mobile
applications, will only display the 0 results.

If required, it is also possible to specify the calculated result of the
formula using the `worksheet_write_formula_num()` function.

See also @ref working_with_formulas.

@section bugs_images Images not displayed correctly in Excel 2001 for Mac and non-Excel applications

Images inserted into worksheets via `worksheet_insert_image()` may not display
correctly in Excel 2011 for Mac and non-Excel applications such as OpenOffice
and LibreOffice. Specifically the images may looked stretched or squashed.

This is not an XlsxWriter issue. It also occurs with files created in Excel
2007 and Excel 2010.


@section bugs_reporting Reporting Bugs

Here are some tips on reporting bugs in `libxlsxwriter`.

@subsection bugs_upgrade Upgrade to the latest version of the library

The bug you are reporting may already be fixed in the latest version of
the module.

Check the @ref changes section to see what has changed in the latest
versions.

You can check which version of `libxlsxwriter` that you are using by compiling
and running the following program:

@code
#include <stdio.h>
#include "xlsxwriter.h"

int main() {

    printf("Libxlsxwriter version = %s\n", LXW_VERSION);

    return 0;
}
@endcode


@subsection bugs_docs Read the documentation

Read or search the `libxlsxwriter` documentation to see if the issue you are
encountering is already explained.


@subsection bugs_examples Look at the example programs

There are many @ref examples in the distribution. Try to identify an example
program that corresponds to your query and adapt it to use as a bug report.

@subsection bugs_issues Use the xlsxwriter Issue tracker

The [libxlsxwriter issue tracker]
(https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues) is on GitHub.


@subsection bugs_tips Tips for submitting a bug report

1.  Describe the problem as clearly and as concisely as possible.
2.  Include a sample program. This is probably the most important step.
    It is generally easier to describe a problem in code than in written
    prose.
3.  The sample program should be as small as possible to demonstrate the
    problem. Don't copy and paste large non-relevant sections of your
    program.

A sample bug report is shown below. This format helps analyze and respond to
the bug report more quickly.

    Issue with SOMETHING

    I am using libxlsxwriter to do SOMETHING but it appears to do SOMETHING ELSE.

    I am using CC version X.Y.Z, OS = uname and libxlsxwriter x.y.z.

    Here is some code that demonstrates the problem:

    #include "xlsxwriter.h"

    int main() {

        lxw_workbook  *workbook  = workbook_new("bug_report.xlsx");
        lxw_worksheet *worksheet = workbook_add_worksheet(workbook, NULL);

        worksheet_write_string(worksheet, 0, 0, "Hello", NULL);
        worksheet_write_number(worksheet, 1, 0, 123, NULL);

        return workbook_close(workbook);
    }
