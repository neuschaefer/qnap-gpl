linux-igd (1.0+cvs20070630-1) unstable; urgency=low

  For compatibility with upstream, the INT_IFACE and EXT_IFACE
  variables have been renamed to INTIFACE and EXTIFACE.  This affects
  /etc/default/linux-igd and /etc/init.d/linux-igd (formerly
  named /etc/default/upnpd and /etc/init.d/upnpd).

  PLEASE REMEMBER, YOU NEED TO UPDATE THESE VARIABLES IN
  /etc/default/linux-igd OR THE DAEMON WILL NOT START.

  The linux-igd project has renamed the insert_forward_rules option to
  create_forward_rules to better reflect what it actually does, i.e. add
  forwarding rules to the forward chain.

  Also added the forward_rules_append to do what people thought
  insert_forward_rules did, i.e. control whether the rules are appended
  (to end) or inserted (at the beginning) in the forward chain. The
  option description also includes a tip about what to do if neither
  insert or append is what you need.

  See /usr/share/doc/linux-igd/CHANGES.gz .

  SECURITY NOTE
  -------------

  This SOFTWARE IS A BETA RELEASE AND NO CLAIMS ARE MADE TO ITS SECURITY
  OR ITS FUNCTIONALITY.

  Be aware that, even if this software and the upnp libraries all prove
  to be bug free and completely secure, the Microsoft Internet Gateway
  Device is designed to allow any computer that has access to the daemon
  to open up any ports on your firewall and give incoming port forwarding
  to any other port on any internal computer.
