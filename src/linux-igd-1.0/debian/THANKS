REMINDERS and THANK YOUS
------------------------

Truth is I can't remember everyone to thank, but I especially want to thank 
both Henri Manson and Anders Betner for their development and testing work.  
Also Eric Wirt, for helping us test, and providing the winning comments for 
switching to C, alongside many others contributing patches and help.

This is a work in progress.  This code is simply released now for others to 
help us debug some problems we are having.  Please, help us out by checking 
the forums, answering problems, and giving any advice and suggestions you can 
to the open source community.

Thanks a lot to the users, and to the over 10,000 downloads, and countless 
CVS checkouts.  If it weren't for the interest in the program, we wouldn't be 
touching it (ok maybe i would, when i got bored or something) :-)

Cheers all

Dime
