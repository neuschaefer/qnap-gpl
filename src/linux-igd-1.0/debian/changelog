linux-igd (1.0+cvs20070630-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (Closes: #411875)
  * New upstream CVS (Closes: #436919, #436365), including important
    option name changes:
    - Renamed the insert_forward_rules option to create_forward_rules to
      better reflect what it actually does.
    - Added the forward_rules_append to do what people thought
      insert_forward_rules did.
    See /usr/share/doc/linux-igd/CHANGES.gz for further details.
  * For compatibility with upstream, the INT_IFACE and EXT_IFACE
    initscript variables have been renamed to INTIFACE and EXTIFACE.
  * Rename initscript and defaults from /etc/{init.d,default}/upnpd to
    /etc/*/linux-igd so that they match our package name.
  * Change initscript to do nothing until /etc/default/linux-igd is
    configured (Closes: #423189, #399960).
  * Add --oknodo to all "start-stop-daemon --stop" calls in initscript
    in case daemon wasn't running anyway (Closes: #415981).
  * Configurable CHROOT and USER/GROUP for daemon.
  * Add SECURITY note and sample conf for jailer chroot.
  * Add ALLOW_MULTICAST option for multicast routing setup (compatible
    with upstream).
  * Abstract the patch for #397572 from .diff.gz into separate quilt patch
    01-debian-my_parse_port.diff
  * New patch 02-makefile.diff for fixes to makefile
  * Patch 03-debian-bindtodevice.diff Closes: #441082 (linux-igd does not
    restrict itself to the internal interface) (with further fix from Eric
    Valette).
  * Honour CFLAGS in compilation (thanks Gianluigi Tiesi <sherpya@netfarm.it>
    http://debian.cli.unipi.it/debian/pool/sherpya/l/linux-igd/ ).
  * Update watchfile as per Jochen Friedrich's suggestion.
  * Add paranoid flag to validate port forwarding requests.
  * Remove bashisms from initscript, make it dash-compatible.

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Rename parse_port and service_to_port to my_parse_port and
    my_service_to_port respectively, as they crash with functions already
    defined in /usr/include/iptables.h; fixes FTBFS. (Closes: #397572)
