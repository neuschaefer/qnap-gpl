Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.2 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.2

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.2 fixes a few small bugs and add as few small elements of
functionality.  Possibly the most interesting is the addition of
'README.initramfs' and 'mkinitramfs'.  Feedback on these would be
most welcome.

Changelog Entries:
    -   Assorted bug fixes
    -   Support write-intent-bitmaps on raid10
    -   Support little-endian (Rather than hostendian) bitmaps.
    -   Return correct error code from 'mdadm -S'
    -   Remove extra blank line from 'mdadm -Eb' output.
    -   Improve option parsing so that -a and -b do not have
	optional arguements: the arg is either required or not
	depending on context.
    -   Allow scanning of devices listed in /proc/partitions even
	if they don't appear in /dev.
    -   Support --assume-clean in --create mode as well as --build
    -   Add support for --monitor to report to syslog: -y or --syslog.
	Thanks to Ross Vandegrift
    -   --monitor now reports which device failed in a 'Fail' message
	   This broke with 2.6
    -   Improve chance of array starting properly after a crash.
	mdadm was insisting the event numbers were identical, but this
	isn't needed, and is a problem if the crash was while the metadata
	was being updated.
    -   Support --update==uuid
    -   Added README.initramfs and mkinitramfs to help people use an
	initram for starting md arrays at boot.


Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
