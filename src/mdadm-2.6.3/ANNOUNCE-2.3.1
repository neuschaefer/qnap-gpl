Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.3.1 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.3.1

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.3.1 primarily fixes a few compile problems with 2.3.  Though
there are some functionality changes, they are extremely minor and you
probably won't notice them.

Changelog Entries:
    -   Fixed -O2 compile so I could make and RPM.
    -   Type cast number to be printed %llu so it compiles on 64bit
        machines. (Thanks Luca).
    -   Stop using asm/byteorder.h - to make Redhat happy :-(
    -   Require bitmap files to have a '/' in their name.
    -   Error-check a few syscalls - code from SuSE package.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
