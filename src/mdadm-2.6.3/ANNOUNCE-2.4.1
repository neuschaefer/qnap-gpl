Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.4.1 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.4.1

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

2.4.1 primarily fixes an alignment problem in the version-1
superblock.  This is an incompatible change relating to
raid5-reshape.  Read the change log below.

Changelog Entries:
    -   Honour --write-mostly when adding to an array without persistent
        superblocks.
    -   Fix alignment problem in version-1 superblocks.
	NOTE: This is an incompatable change affecting raid5 reshape.
	If you want to reshape a raid5 using version-1 superblocks,
	use 2.6.17-rc2 or later, and mdadm-2.4.1 or later.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
