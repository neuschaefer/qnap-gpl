Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.5.5 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.5.5

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.5.5 is a bugfix release over 2.5.4.
Hopefully the last before 2.6.

Changelog Entries:
    -   Don't #include linux/blkpg.h as that isn't safe.  Just
	include the content literally.
    -   Reduce maximum bitmap usage when working with bitmap files,
	so that a only single-page allocations are made, even on
	64bit hosts with 4K pages.
    -   Close stray fd in mdassemble so that it can assemble stacked
	devices
    -   If mdassemble finds an array already assembled, it marks it
        read-write.
    -   Remove error in md_open if array is already active.  This isn't
	needed and gets in the ways if an array was created e.g. in
	initramfs, but device doesn't yet exist in /dev.
    -   When --assemble --scan is run, if all arrays that could be found
	have already been started, don't report an error.
    -   Fix a couple of bugs related to raid10 and the new 'offset' layout.
    -   Improve error message when a wrong '--update' option is given.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
