Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.5.6 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.5.6

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.5.6 is a bugfix release over 2.5.5, which it turns out
wasn't the last before 2.6.  Maybe this one?

Changelog Entries:
    -   Fix bug which meant "bitmap=xxx" in mdadm.conf was not handled
	properly.
    -	Documentation updates.
    -   Fix bug that caused infinite loop when doing auto-assembly,
	in certain cases where arrays couldn't be assembled.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
