known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.6.2  adds a  few minor bug  fixes to 2.6.1

Changelog Entries:
    -   --fail detached and --remove faulty can be used to fail and
	remove devices that are no longer physically present.
    -   --export option for --detail or present information in a format
	that can be processed by udev.
    -   fix internal bitmap allocation problems with v1.1, v1.2 metadata.
    -   --help now goes to stdout so you can direct it to a pager.
    -   Various manpage updates.
    -   Make "--grow --add" for linear arrays really work.
    -   --auto-detect to trigger in-kernel autodetect.
    -   Make return code for "--detail --test" more reliable.  Missing
	devices as well as failed devices cause an error.
