mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.6.3  adds a  few minor bug  fixes to 2.6.2

Changelog Entries:
    -   allow --write-behind to be set for --grow.
    -   When adding new disk to an array, don't reserve so much bitmap
        space that the disk cannot store the required data. (Needed when
	1.x array was created with older mdadm).
    -   When adding a drive that was a little too small, we did not get
	the correct error message.
    -   Make sure that if --assemble find an array in the critical region
	of a reshape, and cannot find the critical data to restart the
	reshape, it gives an error message.
    -   Fix segfault with '--detail --export' and non-persistent
        superblocks.
    -   Various manpage updates.
    -   Improved 'raid4' support (--assemble, --monitor)
    -   Option parsing fixes w.r.t -a
    -   Interpret "--assemble --metadata=1" to allow any version 1.x
	metadata, and be more specific in the "metadata=" message printed
	with --examine --brief
    -   Fix spare migration in --monitor.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
