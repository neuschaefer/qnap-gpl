.TH MDADM.CONF 5
.SH NAME
mdadm.conf \- configuration for management of Software RAID with mdadm
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/mdadm.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B mdadm
is a tool for creating, managing, and monitoring RAID devices using the
.B md
driver in Linux.
.PP
Some common tasks, such as assembling all arrays, can be simplified
by describing the devices and arrays in this configuration file.

.SS SYNTAX
The file should be seen as a collection of words separated by white
space (space, tab, or newline).
Any word that beings with a hash sign (#) starts a comment and that
word together with the remainder of the line is ignored.

Any line that starts with white space (space or tab) is treated as
though it were a continuation of the previous line.

Empty lines are ignored, but otherwise each (non continuation) line
must start with a keyword as listed below.  The keywords are case
insensitive and can be abbreviated to 3 characters.

The keywords are:
.TP
.B DEVICE
A
.B device
line lists the devices (whole devices or partitions) that might contain
a component of an MD array.  When looking for the components of an
array,
.B mdadm
will scan these devices (or any devices listed on the command line).

The
.B device
line may contain a number of different devices (separated by spaces)
and each device name can contain wild cards as defined by
.BR glob (7).

Also, there may be several device lines present in the file.

Alternatively, a
.B device
line can contain the word
.BR partitions .
This will cause
.I mdadm
to read
.I /proc/partitions
and include all devices and partitions found therein.
.I mdadm
does not use the names from
.I /proc/partitions
but only the major and minor device numbers.  It scans
.I /dev
to find the name that matches the numbers.

If no DEVICE line is present, then "DEVICE partitions" is assumed.

For example:
.IP
DEVICE /dev/hda* /dev/hdc*
.br
DEV    /dev/sd*
.br
DEVICE /dev/discs/disc*/disc
.br
DEVICE partitions

.TP
.B ARRAY
The ARRAY lines identify actual arrays.  The second word on the line
should be the name of the device where the array is normally
assembled, such as
.BR  /dev/md1 .
Subsequent words identify the array, or identify the array as a member
of a group. If multiple identities are given,
then a component device must match ALL identities to be considered a
match.  Each identity word has a tag, and equals sign, and some value.
The tags are:

.RS 4
.TP
.B uuid=
The value should be a 128 bit uuid in hexadecimal, with punctuation
interspersed if desired.  This must match the uuid stored in the
superblock.
.TP
.B name=
The value should be a simple textual name as was given to
.I mdadm
when the array was created.  This must match the name stored in the
superblock on a device for that device to be included in the array.
Not all superblock formats support names.
.TP
.B super\-minor=
The value is an integer which indicates the minor number that was
stored in the superblock when the array was created. When an array is
created as /dev/mdX, then the minor number X is stored.
.TP
.B devices=
The value is a comma separated list of device names or device name
patterns.
Only devices with names which match one entry in the list will be used
to assemble the array.  Note that the devices 
listed there must also be listed on a DEVICE line.
.TP
.B level=
The value is a raid level.  This is not normally used to
identify an array, but is supported so that the output of

.B "mdadm \-\-examine \-\-scan"

can be use directly in the configuration file.
.TP
.B num\-devices=
The value is the number of devices in a complete active array.  As with
.B level=
this is mainly for compatibility with the output of

.BR "mdadm \-\-examine \-\-scan" .

.TP
.B spares=
The value is a number of spare devices to expect the array to have.
.B mdadm \-\-monitor
will report an array if it is found to have fewer than this number of
spares when
.B \-\-monitor
starts or when
.B \-\-oneshot
is used.

.TP
.B spare\-group=
The value is a textual name for a group of arrays.  All arrays with
the same
.B spare\-group
name are considered to be part of the same group.  The significance of
a group of arrays is that
.B mdadm
will, when monitoring the arrays, move a spare drive from one array in
a group to another array in that group if the first array had a failed
or missing drive but no spare.

.TP
.B auto=
This option declares to
.B mdadm
that it should try to create the device file of the array if it
doesn't already exist, or exists but with the wrong device number.

The value of this option can be "yes" or "md" to indicate that a
traditional, non-partitionable md array should be created, or "mdp",
"part" or "partition" to indicate that a partitionable md array (only
available in linux 2.6 and later) should be used.  This later set can
also have a number appended to indicate how many partitions to create
device files for, e.g.
.BR auto=mdp5 .
The default is 4.

.TP
.B bitmap=
The option specifies a file in which a write-intent bitmap should be
found.  When assembling the array,
.I mdadm
will provide this file to the
.B md
driver as the bitmap file.  This has the same function as the
.B \-\-bitmap\-file
option to
.BR \-\-assemble .

.TP
.B metadata=
Specify the metadata format that the array has.  This is mainly
recognised for comparability with the output of
.BR "mdadm \-Es" .

.RE

.TP
.B MAILADDR
The
.B mailaddr
line gives an E-mail address that alerts should be
sent to when
.M mdadm
is running in
.B \-\-monitor
mode (and was given the
.B \-\-scan
option).  There should only be one
.B MAILADDR
line and it should have only one address.


.TP
.B MAILFROM
The
.B mailfrom
line (which can only be abbreviated to at least 5 characters) gives an
address to appear in the "From" address for alert mails.  This can be
useful if you want to explicitly set a domain, as the default from
address is "root" with no domain.  All words on this line are
catenated with spaces to form the address.

Note that this value cannot be set via the
.I mdadm
commandline.  It is only settable via the config file.

.TP
.B PROGRAM
The
.B program
line gives the name of a program to be run when
.B "mdadm \-\-monitor"
detects potentially interesting events on any of the arrays that it
is monitoring.  This program gets run with two or three arguments, they
being the Event, the md device, and possibly the related component
device.

There should only be one
.B program
line and it should be give only one program.


.TP
.B CREATE
The
.B create
line gives default values to be used when creating arrays and device entries for
arrays.
These include:

.RS 4
.TP
.B owner=
.TP
.B group=
These can give user/group ids or names to use instead of system
defaults (root/wheel or root/disk).
.TP
.B mode=
An octal file mode such as 0660 can be given to override the default
of 0600.
.TP
.B auto=
This corresponds to the
.B \-\-auto
flag to mdadm.  Give
.BR yes ,
.BR md ,
.BR mdp ,
.B part
\(em possibly followed by a number of partitions \(em to indicate how
missing device entries should be created.

.TP
.B metadata=
The name of the metadata format to use if none is explicitly given.
This can be useful to impose a system-wide default of version-1 superblocks.

.TP
.B symlinks=no
Normally when creating devices in
.B /dev/md/
.I mdadm
will create a matching symlink from
.B /dev/
with a name starting
.B md
or
.BR md_ .
Give
.B symlinks=no
to suppress this symlink creation.
