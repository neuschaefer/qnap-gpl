When creating files in here, use the following 4 headers:

Desc: A brief description of the document
File: The filename (this is for tracking which one is the original)
Date: The date of last modification
Auth: The author, i.e. "First Last <foo@example.com>".

Note: anything in the form <.*@.*> will be removed when converted to HTML
to reduce the number of e-mail addresses harvested from the web servers.
