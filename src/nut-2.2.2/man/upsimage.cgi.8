.SH DESCRIPTION

generates the graphical bars that make up the right side
of the page generated by \fBupsstats.cgi\fR(8).  These represent the
current battery charge, utility voltage, and UPS load where available.

The images are in PNG format, and are created by linking to Boutell's
excellent gd library.
