# nut-upsd: NUT upsd start-up and shutdown script
#

# Allowed exit values:
#       0 = success; causes "OK" to show up in checklist.
#       1 = failure; causes "FAIL" to show up in checklist.
#       2 = skip; causes "N/A" to show up in the checklist.
#           Use this value if execution of this script is overridden
#           by the use of a control variable, or if this script is not
#           appropriate to execute for some other reason.
#       3 = reboot; causes the system to be rebooted after execution.

# Input and output:
#       stdin is redirected from /dev/null
#
#       stdout and stderr are redirected to the /etc/rc.log file
#       during checklist mode, or to the console in raw mode.
