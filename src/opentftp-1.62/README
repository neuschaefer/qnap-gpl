This server (opentftpdspV1.6x) is single port TFTP Server based on Trivial File
Transfer Protocol and is normally used for PXE Boot or other Network Boots. It
supports advance options like tsize, blksize, block number rollover and timeout.

There is one multiport version (opentftpdmtV1.6x) also available on website. If
you do not have firewall issues, you should use that. Multiport server accepts
all requests on listening port but responds on a new port for each request, using
a separate thread. Multithreaded version runs little faster.

On contrary, this single port server responds to requests back on same
listening port. This way firewall need to be opened for one port only.
Despite using single port, it too can serve multiple clients at same time.

This is stable Release 1.62

DOWNLOAD

The latest version can be downloaded from http://tftp-server.sourceforge.net/

INSTALLATION

Expand the .gz file to an directory, using shell, goto that directory,
edit opentftpd.ini file (may just specify home dir), move opentftpd.ini
file to /etc directory or specify file locations with -i and -l flags.
For daemonizing, look at section DAEMONIZING below.

COMPILING

The included file opentftpd is an executive file for Linux/Intel only.
YOU NEED TO RE-COMPILE ON Other Platforms like AIX, Solaris on GCC as:-

g++ opentftpd.cpp -oopentftpd -lpthread 
c++ opentftpd.cpp -oopentftpd -lsocket -lnsl -lpthread (on Solaris)

TESTING

This server runs in Debug Mode (with flag -v) or as Service (without any flag).
give following command as root:-

opentftpd#./opentftpd -v

You will see following results:-

Starting TFTP...
Alias / is mapped to /home/
Listening On: 192.168.0.19
Listening On: 127.0.0.1
Permitted Clients: All
max blksize: 9192
default blksize: 512
default interval: 5
Overwrite Existing Files: Yes

Accepting Requests...

Now open one more shell and give following commands:-

$tftp localhost
tftp>get [some file name in home dir]
Received 13112 bytes in 0.0 seconds

and on server you may see
client 127.0.0.1:xxxxx file ...... # blocks served

RUNNING

This program runs in two modes:-
a) Verbatim Mode (using -v argument)
b) Daemon (not using -v argument)

This program uses helper files:-
i)   -i[inifile], where configuration settings can be specified,
     default is /etc/opentftpd.ini
ii) -l[logfile] dumps log to this file in daemon mode, default is syslog

You can run as:-

/opt/opentftpdsp/opentftpd (daemon with default files)
/opt/opentftpdsp/opentftpd -v (verbatim with default files)
/opt/opentftpdsp/opentftpd -i inifile -l logfile (as daemon)
/opt/opentftpdsp/opentftpd -i inifile (as daemon)
/opt/opentftpdsp/opentftpd  -v -i inifile as verbatim

DAEMONIZING

This program should be setup to start automatically
modifying boot scripts in /etc/rc.d/rc.local file
or /etc/inittab file or /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file.
Never include -v (verbatim flag) while running
as Daemon from these scripts. There are two alternatives:-

i)  Just add the start line in any of above files.
ii) Add the enclosed rc.opentftpd script in /etc/rc.d
    and make it executable (755). Also you need to add the
    lines:-
	    # Start the Dual DHCP DNS Server daemon:
	    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.opentftpd ]; then
	      /etc/rc.d/rc.opentftpd start
	    fi
    to any of above scripts (preferably to /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2)

Alternative ii) is recommended

CONFIGURATION

You need home directory(s) to be set in opentftpd.ini file, and
move this ini file to /etc directory. you may leave other
parameters commented like blksize and interval.

You can use single directory as HOME directory. That case, all paths are 
appended to HOME directory. For example, your entry under [HOME] is:-

[HOME]
/opt/bootfiles

Then any request would be translated as
"get myfile/bootfile.boot" to /opt/bootfiles/myfile/bootfile.boot on server.
it would be simply prepended to requested file path.

But if you use an alias like

[HOME]
a=/opt/bootfiles
b=/asdf/sdf/sfsd
c=/opt/sfrd/dsfr

Then your requests would be translated as:-

"get a/myfile/bootfile.boot" to /opt/bootfiles/myfile/bootfile.boot
"get b/myfile/bootfile.boot" to /asdf/sdf/sfsd/myfile/bootfile.boot
"get c/myfile/bootfile.boot" to /opt/sfrd/dsfr/myfile/bootfile.boot

on server (alias would be substituted with it's value)

In this case any request, not starting with any of alias a,b,c would be errored out.
The advantage of using alias is you can specify multiple locations.

DEBUG

If program is not responding:-

1) Ensure that you start this program as root only if listening on ports less than 1024.
   Even if you have specified username in ini file, program need to start as root for
   these ports and it will automatically switch to specified user, as it starts.
2) Run in verbatim mode first (with -v flag), it will provide all debug information
   as it verbatim the activities.
3) Errors like "bind failed" means another opentftpd is running and listening at same
   port (default 69). You can only have one server listening on a port at a time. It may also
   come if interface specified under [LISTEN-ON] is not physically available on Server.
   If you have specified [LISTEN-ON] option, check that ip and interface are Active.
   This error may still come if you are not starting the server as root, you cannot listen
   on ports less than 1024, refer point 1) above.
4) You may try recompiling (see COMPILING above).
5) Errors like "libstdc++.so.?: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" 
   are possible in some Unix/Linux flavors. Please recompile the program or create symbolic
   links:-
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/libstdc++.so.? /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.? 
	ln -s /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.so.? /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.?
   (? is library version as reported in error)
   or add the library path (directory where above file is) to env variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
6) Max size of file being transferred depends on block size, the max block count being 65536,
   it would be 512*65536 or 32MB. This limitation can be increased by increasing block size
   upto 65464 which makes the max file size to 4.2 GB. However the block size also depend on
   client. Most clients like Unix/Linux support block number rollover, which make the max 
   file size unlimited, irrespective of block size.

UNINSTALLATION

Just remove the program directory. You should also remove entries from initialize scripts of 
your machine.
