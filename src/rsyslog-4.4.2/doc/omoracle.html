<p>From the header comments of this module:
<p><pre>

    This is an output module feeding directly to an Oracle
    database. It uses Oracle Call Interface, a propietary module
    provided by Oracle.

    Selector lines to be used are of this form:

    :omoracle:;TemplateName

    The module gets its configuration via rsyslog $... directives,
    namely:

    $OmoracleDBUser: user name to log in on the database.

    $OmoracleDBPassword: password to log in on the database.

    $OmoracleDB: connection string (an Oracle easy connect or a db
    name as specified by tnsnames.ora)

    $OmoracleBatchSize: Number of elements to send to the DB on each
    transaction.

    $OmoracleStatement: Statement to be prepared and executed in
    batches. Please note that Oracle's prepared statements have their
    placeholders as ':identifier', and this module uses the colon to
    guess how many placeholders there will be.

    All these directives are mandatory. The dbstring can be an Oracle
    easystring or a DB name, as present in the tnsnames.ora file.

    The form of the template is just a list of strings you want
    inserted to the DB, for instance:

    $template TestStmt,"%hostname%%msg%"

    Will provide the arguments to a statement like

    $OmoracleStatement \
        insert into foo(hostname,message)values(:host,:message)

    Also note that identifiers to placeholders are arbitrarry. You
    need to define the properties on the template in the correct order
    you want them passed to the statement!
