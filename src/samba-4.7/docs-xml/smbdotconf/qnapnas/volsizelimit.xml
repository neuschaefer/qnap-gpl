	<para>QNAPNAS parameters. vol size limit = size in MiB</para>
	<para>
	Useful for Time Machine: limits the reported volume size, thus preventing Time Machine from using the whole real disk space for backup.
	IMPORTANT: This is an approximated calculation taking into account the contents of Time Machine sparsebundle images. 
	Therefor you MUST NOT use this volume to store other content when using this option, because it would NOT be accounted. 
	The calculation works by reading the band size from the Info.plist XML file of the sparsebundle, 
	reading the bands/ directory counting the number of band files, and then multiplying one with the other.
