	sg_readcap, sg_reset, sg_scan, sg_start, sg_test_rwbuf,
	sg_turs and sginfo

Eric Youngdale <eric@andante.org> author of scsi_info on which sginfo
	is based.

	the original sg driver

Pat LaVarre <p.lavarre@ieee.org> pointed out danger of negate bpt values
        in sg_dd (and friends); also problems when reading /dev/null
