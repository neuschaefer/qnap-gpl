make
make install

Unless overridden or edited in the Makefile, INSTDIR places the executables
in the /usr/local/bin directory while MANDIR places the man pages in the
/usr/local/man directory.

Other Makefile targets that might be useful:
make clean	# remove .o, executables, core and .depend file
make depend	# generate dependency hierarchy in .depend file
make dep   	# same as 'make depend'
make sg_scan   	# build a specific executable (e.g. 'sg_scan')
make uninstall

Note that the main Makefile does _not_ call the Makefiles in the
subdirectories (i.e. archive, examples and utils directories).


A "spec" file is included for building rpm packages. Place a copy of
the tarball in the "SOURCES" directory and place a copy of sg3_utils.spec
in the "SPEC" directory. Then from the "SPEC" directory execute 
"rpmbuild -ba sg3_utils.spec". If all goes well a source rpm should be 
found in the SRPMS directory and a binary rpm in the RPMS/i386 directory
(for i386 architecture). Note the spec file will only build those utilities
in the main directory. When the binary rpm is installed the executables
and their associated man pages should be placed in appropriate places.
