This archive directory contains programs the use the Linux SCSI
subsystem and typically use the SCSI generic interface (sg) as
well.

The programs in this directory are fully functional but have been
"retired" from the main sg3_utils directory most likely because
their functionality is done in another (perhaps better) way.

The last time I checked these programs compiled and built and
didn't depend on too many other things (see the Makefile in the
parent directory for ideas).

Since I actively use some of these programs for testing, a Makefile has
been set up which builds:
    - sgq_dd   [a dd variant the uses a dispatch loop rather than
                POSIX threads (as does sgp_dd)]
    - sg_hold  holds a sg device open and periodically sends a TEST
		UNIT READY command to the device
    - sg_poll  [internal testing]
    - isosize  available in util-linux-2.10s and later

The sg_err.h and llseek.h headers have simply been copied from the parent
directory.

The very useful rescan-scsi-bus.sh script from Kurt Garloff<kurt@garloff.de>
is included in this directory.

A test program called sg_bus_xfer.c exercises a patch that adds a
SG_FLAG_BUS_ADDR capability. This allows a bus address (e.g. PCI
video card's frame buffer) to be passed through to a SCSI adapter
to side step various buffer copies. See:
