.TH SG_TEST_RWBUF "8" "November 2003" "sg3_utils-1.05" SG3_UTILS
.SH NAME
sg_test_rwbuf \- Tests the SCSI host adapter by issueing write and read 
operations on a device's buffer and calculating checksums.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sg_test_rwbuf
<\fIgeneric device\fR>
<\fIsz\fR> 
[\fIaddwr\fR]
[\fIaddrd\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
sg_test_rwbuf writes and reads back sz bytes to the internal buffer of
device <\fIgeneric device\fR> (e.g. /dev/sg0). A pseudo random pattern is
written to the data buffer on the device then read back. If the same pattern
is found 'Success' is reported. If they do not match (checksums unequal) then
this is reported and up to 24 bytes from the first point of mismatch are
reported; the first line shows what was written and the second line shows
what was received. For testing purposes, you can ask it to write (addwr) or
read (addrd) additional bytes.
.PP
The microcode in a SCSI device is _not_ modified by doing a WRITE BUFFER
command with its mode set to "data" (0x2) as done by this utility. Therefore
this utility is safe in that respect. [Mode values 0x4, 0x5, 0x6 and 0x7
are the dangerous ones :-)]
.PP
\fBWARNING\fR: If you access the device at the same time, e.g. because it's a
mounted hard disk, the device's buffer may be used by the device
itself for other data at the same time, and overwriting it may or may
not cause data corruption! \fBHOWEVER\fR the SPC-3 draft standard does state
in its WRITE BUFFER command: "This command shall not alter any medium of the
logical unit when data mode ... is specified". This implies that it _is_ safe
to use this utility with devices that have mounted file systems on them.
Following this theme further, a disk with active mounted file systems may cause
the data read back to be different (due to caching activity) to what was written
and hence a checksum error.
