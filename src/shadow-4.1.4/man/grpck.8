.SH "NAME"
grpck \- verify integrity of group files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBgrpck\fR\ 'u
\fBgrpck\fR [\-r] [\fIgroup\fR\ [\ \fIshadow\fR\ ]]
.HP \w'\fBgrpck\fR\ 'u
\fBgrpck\fR [\-s] [\fIgroup\fR\ [\ \fIshadow\fR\ ]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBgrpck\fR
command verifies the integrity of the system authentication information\&. All entries in
/etc/group
and /etc/gshadow
are checked to see that the entry has the proper format and valid data in each field\&. The user is prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or which have other uncorrectable errors\&.
.PP
Checks are made to verify that each entry has:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
the correct number of fields
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
a unique group name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
a valid list of members and administrators
.RE
.PP
The checks for correct number of fields and unique group name are fatal\&. If the entry has the wrong number of fields, the user will be prompted to delete the entire line\&. If the user does not answer affirmatively, all further checks are bypassed\&. An entry with a duplicated group name is prompted for deletion, but the remaining checks will still be made\&. All other errors are warnings and the user is encouraged to run the
\fBgroupmod\fR
command to correct the error\&.
.PP
The commands which operate on the
/etc/group
file are not able to alter corrupted or duplicated entries\&.
\fBgrpck\fR
should be used in those circumstances to remove the offending entry\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The options which apply to the
\fBgrpck\fR
command are:
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Execute the
\fBgrpck\fR
command in read\-only mode\&. This causes all questions regarding changes to be answered
\fIno\fR
without user intervention\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4
Sort entries in
/etc/group
and /etc/gshadow
by GID\&.
.RE
.PP
By default,
\fBgrpck\fR
operates on
/etc/groupand /etc/gshadow\&. The user may select alternate files with the
\fIgroup\fR
and \fIshadow\fR parameters\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The following configuration variables in
/etc/login\&.defs
change the behavior of this tool:
.PP
\fBMAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP\fR (number)
.RS 4
Maximum members per group entry\&. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in
/etc/group
(with the same name, same password, and same GID)\&.
.sp
The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group\&.
.sp
This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file\&. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters\&.
.sp
If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25\&.
.sp
Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the Shadow toolsuite)\&. You should not use this variable unless you really need it\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/etc/group
.RS 4
Group account information\&.
.RE
.PP
/etc/gshadow
.RS 4
Secure group account information\&.
.RE
.PP
/etc/passwd
.RS 4
User account information\&.
