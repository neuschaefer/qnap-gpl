/**
 * @brief RAII management of a SQLite Database Connection.
 *
 * A Database object manage a list of all SQLite Statements associated with the
 * underlying SQLite 3 database connection.
 *
 * Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) means that the Database Connection
 * is opened in the constructor and closed in the destructor, so that there is
 * no need to worry about memory management or the validity of the underlying SQLite Connection.
 *
 * Thread-safety: a Database object shall not be shared by multiple threads, because :
 * 1) in the SQLite "Thread Safe" mode, "SQLite can be safely used by multiple threads
 *    provided that no single database connection is used simultaneously in two or more threads."
 * 2) the SQLite "Serialized" mode is not supported by SQLiteC++,
 *    because of the way it shares the underling SQLite precompiled statement
 *    in a custom shared pointer (See the inner class "Statement::Ptr").
