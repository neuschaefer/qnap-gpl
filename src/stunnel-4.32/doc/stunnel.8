.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBstunnel\fR program is designed to work as \fI\s-1SSL\s0\fR encryption wrapper 
between remote clients and local (\fIinetd\fR\-startable) or remote
servers. The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons running on
your system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over
secure \s-1SSL\s0 channels.
.PP
\&\fBstunnel\fR can be used to add \s-1SSL\s0 functionality to commonly used \fIInetd\fR
daemons like \s-1POP\-2\s0, \s-1POP\-3\s0, and \s-1IMAP\s0 servers, to standalone daemons like
\&\s-1NNTP\s0, \s-1SMTP\s0 and \s-1HTTP\s0, and in tunneling \s-1PPP\s0 over network sockets without
changes to the source code.

Note that if you wish to run \fBstunnel\fR in \fIinetd\fR mode (where it
is provided a network socket by a server such as \fIinetd\fR, \fIxinetd\fR,

.Sp
This is the directory in which \fBstunnel\fR will look for certificates when using
the \fIverify\fR. Note that the certificates in this directory should be named

.Sp
A \s-1PEM\s0 is always needed in server mode.
Specifying this flag in client mode will use this certificate chain
as a client side certificate chain.  Using client side certs is optional.
The certificates must be in \s-1PEM\s0 format and must be sorted starting with the
certificate to the highest level (root \s-1CA\s0).
.IP "\fBciphers\fR = cipherlist" 4
.IX Item "ciphers = cipherlist"
Select permitted \s-1SSL\s0 ciphers
.Sp

.IX Item "CRLpath = directory"
Certificate Revocation Lists directory
.Sp
This is the directory in which \fBstunnel\fR will look for CRLs when
using the \fIverify\fR. Note that the CRLs in this directory should
be named \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0.0 where \s-1XXXXXXXX\s0 is the hash value of the \s-1CRL\s0.

.Sp
\&\fBRemote mode\fR (either 2.2.x and >=2.6.28) requires stunnel to be executed as
root.  \fBsetuid\fR option will also break this functionality.
.Sp

.Sp
\&\fBLinux 2.2.x\fR requires kernel to be compiled with \fItransparent proxy\fR option.

.Ve
.Sp
It is important to understand, that this option was solely designed for access
control and not for authorization.  Specifically for level 2 every non-revoked
certificate is accepted regardless of its Common Name.  For this reason a
dedicated \s-1CA\s0 should be used with level 2, and not a generic \s-1CA\s0 commonly used
for webservers.  Level 3 is preferred for point-to-point connections.

.SS "\s-1RESTRICTIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "RESTRICTIONS"
\&\fBstunnel\fR cannot be used for the \s-1FTP\s0 daemon because of the nature
of the \s-1FTP\s0 protocol which utilizes multiple ports for data transfers.
There are available \s-1SSL\s0 enabled versions of \s-1FTP\s0 and telnet daemons, however.
.SS "\s-1INETD\s0 \s-1MODE\s0"
.IX Subsection "INETD MODE"
The most common use of \fBstunnel\fR is to listen on a network
port and establish communication with either a new port
via the connect option, or a new program via the \fIexec\fR option.
However there is a special case when you wish to have
some other program accept incoming connections and
launch \fBstunnel\fR, for example with \fIinetd\fR, \fIxinetd\fR,
or \fItcpserver\fR.
.PP
For example, if you have the following line in \fIinetd.conf\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/stunnel stunnel /etc/stunnel/imaps.conf
.Ve
.PP
In these cases, the \fIinetd\fR\-style program is responsible
for binding a network socket (\fIimaps\fR above) and handing
it to \fBstunnel\fR when a connection is received.
Thus you do not want \fBstunnel\fR to have any \fIaccept\fR option.
All the \fIService Level Options\fR should be placed in the
global options section, and no \fI[service_name]\fR section
will be present.  See the \fI\s-1EXAMPLES\s0\fR section for example
configurations.
.SS "\s-1CERTIFICATES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CERTIFICATES"
Each \s-1SSL\s0 enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509 certificate
to the peer. It also needs a private key to decrypt the incoming
data. The easiest way to obtain a certificate and a key is to 
generate them with the free \fIOpenSSL\fR package. You can find more
information on certificates generation on pages listed below.
.PP
The order of contents of the \fI.pem\fR file is important.  It should contain the
unencrypted private key first, then a signed certificate (not certificate
request).  There should be also empty lines after certificate and private key.
Plaintext certificate information appended on the top of generated certificate
should be discarded. So the file should look like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\&    [encoded key]
\&    \-\-\-\-\-END RSA PRIVATE KEY\-\-\-\-\-
\&    [empty line]
\&    \-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-
\&    [encoded certificate]
\&    \-\-\-\-\-END CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-
\&    [empty line]
.Ve
.SS "\s-1RANDOMNESS\s0"
.IX Subsection "RANDOMNESS"
\&\fBstunnel\fR needs to seed the \s-1PRNG\s0 (pseudo random number generator) in
order for \s-1SSL\s0 to use good randomness.  The following sources are loaded
in order until sufficient random data has been gathered:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified by the \s-1RANDFILE\s0 environment variable, if set.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file .rnd in your home directory, if \s-1RANDFILE\s0 not set.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The file specified with '\-\-with\-random' at compile time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The contents of the screen if running on Windows.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The egd socket specified with the \fI\s-1EGD\s0\fR flag.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The egd socket specified with '\-\-with\-egd\-sock' at compile time.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The /dev/urandom device.
.PP
With recent (>=OpenSSL 0.9.5a) version of \s-1SSL\s0 it will stop loading
random data automatically when sufficient entropy has been gathered.
With previous versions it will continue to gather from all the above
sources since no \s-1SSL\s0 function exists to tell when enough data is available.
.PP
Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user interaction
(mouse movements, creating windows, etc.) the screen contents are not
variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a random file
for use with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag.
.PP
Note that the file specified with the \fIRNDfile\fR flag should contain
random data \*(-- that means it should contain different information
each time \fBstunnel\fR is run.  This is handled automatically
unless the \fIRNDoverwrite\fR flag is used.  If you wish to update this file
manually, the \fIopenssl rand\fR command in recent versions of OpenSSL,
would be useful.
.PP
One important note \*(-- if /dev/urandom is available, OpenSSL has a habit of
seeding the \s-1PRNG\s0 with it even when checking the random state, so on
systems with /dev/urandom you're likely to use it even though it's listed
at the very bottom of the list above.  This isn't \fBstunnel's\fR behaviour, it's
OpenSSLs.
