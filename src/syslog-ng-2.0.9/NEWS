2.0.9
	Sun, 23 Mar 2008 21:36:47 +0100

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed handling more than 256 destinations by changing the
          reference counter type of LogMessages to a 16 bit value.
	* Fixed a possible SIGABRT crash if the hosts file passed to
          dns-cache-hosts() had multiple entries with the same IP address.
	* Fixed a possible crash during startup if "-g" was specified without
          using "-u".


2.0.8
	Thu, 31 Jan 2008 12:38:21 +0100

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed a regression in 2.0.7 that caused destination files not to
          be reopened when syslog-ng was reopened. This causes potential
	  problems with log rotation.
	* Fixed DNS cache size checking, persistent DNS cache entries were
          also counted against dns_cache_size() which might decrease cache
	  space significantly when a large /etc/hosts file is in use.
	* Fixed a bug that caused the persistent DNS cache (e.g. /etc/hosts)
	  to be reloaded for all name resolution requests.

	Other changes:
	* Fixed sample configuration file for RedHat.
	* Some portability changes in loggen.
	* Added cygwin packaging files to contrib/cygwin-packaging.


2.0.7
        Thu, 03 Jan 2008 07:01:59 +0100

        Bugfixes:
        * Fixed UNIX domain socket destinations on Solaris.
        * Fixed flow-control behaviour for follow-mode source files.
        * Added the "mark" keyword to be an alias of "mark_freq" for
          compatibility with syslog-ng 1.6.
        * Fixed message loss in destination files during configuration
          reloads if syslog-ng is heavily loaded.
        * Fixed a possible segmentation fault in the dns-cache-host() file
          parsing code for improperly formatted host files.
        * Fixed possible "Insufficient buffer space" errors in the STREAMS
          driver.
        * Fixed the starvation of the timer used to reap unused destination
          files, which could cause some files never to be closed under
          heavy load.
        * Fixed ISO timestamp parsing for timestamps that have no
          timezone information or have a too long fraction of a second
          portion.
        * Added a workaround for possible deadlocks on /proc/kmsg and
          user terminals.
        * Fixed program name parsing that caused problems for TAG values
          that include the '/' character. This problem was introduced by
          2.0.6.

        Other changes:
        * The fsync() option was implemented.
        * Added support for file sources that do not exist at startup.
        * Added support the "--persist-file" configuration option.
        * Added support for timestamps used by some LinkSys routers.
        * Added loggen tool to generate syslog messages at the specified
          rate.

2.0.6
         Tue, 27 Nov 2007 10:35:27 +0100

         IMPORTANT NOTES:
         * There are two possible Denial of Service fixes in this version of
           syslog-ng, therefore it is strongly recommended to upgrade to this
           version.

         Bugfixes:
         * HP-UX related build and runtime fixes, backported from the Premium
           Edition.
         * If unable to resolve the name of the target host, syslog-ng failed
           to initialize the TCP/UDP destination drivers.
           This behavior has been corrected.
         * Corrected program name parsing in incoming messages.
         * Fixed a problem in handling messages which lacked explicit timezone
           information, but the administrator specified a timezone for the
           messages.
         * Fixed some minor memory leaks in configuration reloads.
         * Fixed a segmentation fault which occurred when the timestamp of the
           incoming messages did not end with a space character (NULL pointer
           dereference). This is an easy Denial of Service possibility.
         * Fixed a segmentation fault which occurred when the PID macro was used
           and the message had a closing bracket (']') before an opening
           bracket ('[').
         * Fixed a possible segmentation fault for UDP6/TCP6 destinations.
         * Fixed IPv6 scope id resolution for link-local addresses.
         * Solaris related fixes.

2.0.5
	Sun, 22 Jul 2007 15:15:18 +0200

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed the configure script to automatically detect whether
	  libnet is installed and disable spoof-source support if it
	  isn't.
	* Fixed the processing of the global log_fifo_size() option, in some
	  cases the global option did not have an effect.
	* Fixed possible blocking on /proc/kmsg during boot, when a great
          number of messages kernel messages are generated.
	* Fixed a possible segfault during the syslog-ng exit procedure,
	  that can be triggered by stopping a syslog-ng instance after it
	  had been reloaded at least once.

	Other changes:
	* Increased the default value for max-connections to 256 for UNIX
	  stream sources.
	* Added support for PIX timestamps that includes year information.
	* Added support for fractions of a second information in BSD
          timestamps generated by some Cisco gear.


2.0.4
        Mon, 14 May 2007 11:47:48 +0200
        
        IMPORTANT NOTES:
        * This version of syslog-ng fixes a bug in enforcing the 
          max-connections() limit for various stream-like sources 
          (unix-stream and tcp). Previously this limit was not enforced, 
          thus production environments may use an inadequate value. 
          Validate your max-connection() settings before upgrading 
          and check your logs for rejected connections.

        Bugfixes:
        * Fixed configuration parsing of the localport() and port() parameters.
        * Fixed template_escape() for non-ASCII characters.
        * Fixed facility() filter evaluation problems.
        * Fixed a possible segmentation fault during shutdown, when pending
          messages were still present in the destination queue of a
          flow-controlled destination.
        * Fixed sign of timezone when parsed from the configuration file.
        * Fixed counting the number of established connections, the value
          used when comparing against the max-connections() parameter.

        Features:
        * Added support for rotated source files.
        * Added support for perl-like regexp flags to make it possible to
          specify case-insensitive regular expressions.

2.0.3
	Mon, 26 Mar 2007 14:10:00 +0200

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault in the usertty() destination
          driver when it was referenced on a log path with disabled
	  flow-control.
	* Fixed various usertty() functionality problems.
	* Removed the 1024 byte limitation of internally generated messages.
	* Clarified the text of various internal messages, consistency
	  updates for message severities.
	* Increased the minimum value for log_fifo_size to 1000 elements.
	* HP-UX portability fixes.
	* Some minor documentation fixes.

	Features:
	* Added spoof-source support for IPv4 & IPv6 to match 1.6.x
	  functionality.
	* Added support for remembering the last posistion of file sources
          across restarts.
	* Added tcp-wrapper support.
	* Added support for more than 9 regexp matches.
	

2.0.2
	Fri, 26 Jan 2007 08:45:59 +0100

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed compilation problems in dnscache on non-Linux systems, such
	  as Solaris and BSDs
	* Fixed an incompatibility between 1.6.x and 2.0.x when parsing
          user/group information from the configuration file.
	* Remove trailing \0 and \n characters from a message before
          processing, removes an unnecessary trailing space from messages.
	* Fixed handling utmp entries in the usertty() driver, which contain
          a full path to the tty.

	Features:
	* Readded missing tcp-keep-alive() option with a new name consistent
	  with the rest of the socket options (so_keepalive).

2.0.1
	Thu, 21 Dec 2006 09:23:44 +0100

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed a possible syslog-ng hang when a program destination stalled.
	* Fixed source priorities to avoid starving log listeners. If a
          continous stream of messages were processed, this could cause new
          connections not to be accepted, causing a system deadlock.
	* Don't fail startup if a network connection fails.
	* Portability fixes.
	* Fixed another timezone calculation problem.

	Features:
	* Readded missing remove_if_older() functionality which was present 
          in 1.6.x but missing from 2.0.x so far. The name of the option was
          changed to overwrite_if_older(), but the old name remains for
          compatibility.
	* Readded DNS cache functionality, which was missing from the 2.0.x
          branch so far.
	* Added support for static IP->name mapping without reliance on DNS.

	Other changes:
	* Documentation updates.


2.0.0
	Sat, 28 Oct 2006 17:32:50 +0200

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed some compilation warnings when using gcc4
	* Fixed a problem in restarting program destinations, that could
          cause several instance of the program to run.
	* Fixed a UNIX domain socket format issue that sometimes caused a
          memory dump to be displayed in place of the socket name.
	* Fixed a bug in handling broken destination connections.
	
	Other changes:
	* Documentation updates.


2.0rc4
	Tue, 24 Oct 2006 13:33:55 +0200

	Bugfixes:
	* Another leak fix in 2.0rc2 caused syslog-ng to crash when a 
          destination TCP/unix-stream connection was broken.
	* Fixed EOF detection for destination connections.

2.0rc3
	Thu, 14 Sep 2006 14:34:59 +0200

	Bugfixes:
	* One of the leak fixes in 2.0rc2 caused syslog-ng to immediately
	  segfault when a template is specified for an output. This was
          fixed.

2.0rc2
	Mon, 11 Sep 2006 12:06:30 +0200

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed a filter evaluation bug on platforms that have unsigned
          characters by default.
	* Fixed a denial of service problem when a zero sized UDP packet is
          received (was taken as an EOF and the input channel was closed).
	* Fixed NL handling for datagram transports.
	* Fixed IPv6 name resolution.
	* Fixed "Duplicate stats counter" message upon reload for program()
          destinations.
	* Fixed various memory leaks.

2.0rc1
	Sat, 08 Jul 2006 13:52:50 +0200

	Some minor new features:
	* Added LEVEL_NUM and FACILITY_NUM macros.
	* Added optional() support for destination files to avoid flooding
	  the log if a given destination cannot be opened.

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed priority range filter evaluation.
	* Portability fixes for various OSs (Solaris, AIX and HP-UX) and
	  architectures (64bit CPUs)
	* In the case of a broken connection don't reconnect immediately,
	  but wait some time specified by time_reopen() to match 1.6.x
	  behaviour.
	* Fixed a reproducible segmentation fault in UNIX domain socket
          destinations.
	* Fixed dir_group() handling.

	Other changes:
	* Documentation updates.


1.9.11
	Tue, 23 May 2006 19:45:21 +0200

	Some minor new features:
	* Added IPv6 support.
	* Added multicast support.

	Bugfixes:
        * Avoid changing owner/group/permission information for files that
          do not exist, to avoid clobbering the error value.
	* Added close-on-exec flag to avoid inheriting file descriptors for
	  programs started by syslog-ng.
	* Fixed an off-by-one in flush_lines() calculation.
	* Fixed a possible memory leak.
	* Fixed a CPU spinning possibility when a non-existing filter is
          referenced on the log path the processes internal() messages.
	* Fixed hanging on reading /proc/kmsg on Linux.
	* Fixed sun-streams() fetching problem on Solaris.

	Other changes:
	* Documentation updates.


1.9.10
	Mon, 10 Apr 2006 23:33:16 +0200

	Some minor new features:
	* Added netmask() filter which was missing from previous releases.
	* Readded an implementation of bad_hostname() and check_hostname().

	Bugfixes:
	* Fixed a possible abort in program() destinations and fix to
	  actually restart spawned processes.
	* Fixed a portability problem in the lexer.
	* Fixed a possible abort when the user specifies two conflicting
          UNIX sources.
	* Disable stats messages instead of busy looping when stats_freq()
	  is set to 0 to match 1.6.x behaviour.
	* Fixed match space expansion ($N references in templates).
	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault on write errors.
	* Fixed filtering on priority levels.
	* Fixed support for files over 2GB.

	Other changes:
	* Documentation updates.

1.9.9
	Sun, 26 Feb 2006 09:49:47 +0100

	Some minor new features:

	* Added optional() option to pipe and unix drivers to make syslog-ng
          start even if the required directories/files do not exist.
	* Added DNS name resolution to udp and tcp targets.
	* Added a stats() keyword for 1.6.x compatibility.
	* Added processed counters for source/destination groups and the log 
          center.
	* Added normalize_hostnames() option which converts all hostnames to
          lower case.
	* Added PID macro.
	* Added kernel flag to sources to indicate that messages coming from
	  the source should default to 'kern.notice' instead of 'user.notice'
	* Added frac_digits() option which controls how many digits are
          printed in second fractions.
	* Added time_sleep() option to add a fixed latency to the poll loop
          required in some tuning situations.
	* Documentation updates.

	Changes:

	* Removed stats entries for files as they never lose messages and it
          would only clutter the log statistics output.
	* The meaning of the undocumented keep_timestamp() option was
	  changed and documented, it controls whether syslog-ng uses the
          time of reception or the time included in the log message.

	Bugfixes:

	* Fixed port unreachable handling for UDP destinations.
	* Fixed PRI macro processing as it included the local hostname in
	  addition to the priority value because of a missing break
	  statement.
	* UNIX domain sockets are kept alive across SIGHUPs by default.
	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault on SIGHUP.
	* Fixed timezone extraction from incoming messages with ISO
	  timestamp (only this syslog-ng can send these currently)
	* Fixed HOST_FROM, FULLHOST_FROM, SOURCEIP, DATE, R_DATE, S_DATE
          macros (some were still not implemented others worked incorrectly
	  in some circumstances)
	* Fixed fractions of a second processing.

1.9.8
	Tue, 20 Dec 2005 21:51:45 +0100

	* Fixed a show-stopper problem in UDP destinations.
	* Fixed a local-time calculation problem.

1.9.7
	Sat, 03 Dec 2005 16:41:58 +0100

	* Reworded documentation on flush_lines & flush_timeout.
	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault on SIGHUP.
	* Fixed a timezone normalization problem.
	* Fixed Solaris support.
	* Fixed MARK support to emit a single mark message only (it was
          previously implemented for all sources)
	* Added Debian packaging files.

1.9.6
	Sat, 15 Oct 2005 18:07:07 +0200

	* Added new options to control buffer flushing (flush_lines and
          flush_timeout, see the documentation for more details)
	* Fixes in local timezone detection, it should properly detect DSTs
          on Linux, Solaris and probably BSDs.
	* Fixed facility/priority filtering.
	* Fixed owner/group/permission setting on target files/directories.
	* Copied the contrib directory as found in 1.6.x to this tree.
	* TZ macro is now an alias of TZOFFSET, as I could not find a
          portable way to determine the string representation of any given
          timezone offset.
	* Added some more unit tests.

1.9.5
	Thu, 07 Jul 2005 11:35:25 +0200

	* Documentation updates on new options.
	* Fixed some timezone related problems cleaned up template specific
        timezones.
	* Fixed destination file permission setting problems.
	* Fixed use_time_recvd() handling, added a note to the documentation
	that this option is deprecated.
	* Fixed a destination file fd/memory leak for macro expanded files.
	* Fixed regexp match references in macro expansion. (e.g.
	"/var/log/$1")
	* Added two new macros: STAMP which formats a timestamp according to
	the ts_format() option, and WEEK which refers to the current week
	number.
	* Linking fixes to support more platforms.
	* Changed local hostname detection to use the value of use_fqdn()
        and actually use a fully expanded hostname if that is true.
	* Fixed some configuration file parsing problems which caused user
        identifiers to be recognized as keywords if they had a common
        prefix.
	* Always add fractions of a second if it was received from the
	application.
	* Fixed a gcc4 compatibility problem.

1.9.4
	Sun, 03 Apr 2005 12:51:55 +0200

	Fixed a macro expansion problem back in february, but did not 
	have time to release it until now. Most important changes in
	this release:

	* Added a fix for the macro expansion problem.
	* Added better error reporting to the configure script.


1.9.3
	Sat, 22 Jan 2005 01:38:07 +0100

	Things are going faster these days, a mere three weeks between
	releases. I've been running syslog-ng 1.9.2 on my notebook, and was
	lucky enough to find one or two major bugs this way, but after
	fixing those things are looking good. I've seen _no_ crashes, though
	sometimes syslog-ng blocked on reading an external fd, thus causing
	a system deadlock. Apart from bugfixes the most important changes
	are that documentation is readded and somewhat even updated with the
	new features. It was funny rereading the sentences I wrote a couple
	of years earlier, fixed some embarassing grammatical mistakes. Now,
	back to the topic, the most important changes in this release are:

	* Solaris portability fixes, one of the snapshots already compiled
	cleanly under Solaris, even though I did not test the release itself.
	* Link against the libraries sitting in /usr statically.
	* Fixed possible deadlock on internal messages, it was a bad idea to
	use a pipe internally, it is now replaced with a conventional queue,
	and a special GSource.
	* Fixed another possible deadlock caused by some fds not being set
	to non-blocking mode.
	* EAGAIN and EINTR was not correctly handled in all cases, fixed
	those.
	* Readded documentation, added new macros, template statements, new
	flags.


1.9.2
	Mon, 03 Jan 2005 22:03:02 +0100

	Well, it's been a long time since the last syslog-ng development
	release simply because I was involved in too many things in
	parallel. Good news that the release is actually quite usable,
	I've been running it on my laptop for a week now and I think it 
	is now time to gather some real life experience. 

	* Fixed a couple of memory leaks.
	* Fixed SIGHUP support.
	* Fixed program startup to make sure all important error information
        is logged.
	* Fixed program destinations by adding setsid() call after forking.
	* Fixed flow controlled log path support.
	* Added the possibility to use braces around macro references (like
        in '${MSG}\n')
	* Added macros missing from this branch added to 1.6.x since the
	last release (PRI and MSGONLY).

1.9.1
	Wed, 22 Jan 2003 12:13:44 +0100

	This release is still not intended for production use. It has a good
	number of new features and a couple of them may not be stable
	enough.

	New features:
	* template declarations, the possibility to define a template once
	  and refer to it
	* flow controlled log paths work, and they are also configurable
	* supports RFC3339 timestamps with second fractions and time zones,
	  time zone conversion & source time zone specification
	* MARK messages are generated
	* keep alive for connections as well as listeners
	* the ability to follow log files as they are written to
	* the possibility to mark parts of a message using standard '(' and
	  ')' regexp operators and refer to matches within templates (either
	  filenames or content)

	This program is still ALPHA.

1.9.0
	Thu,  9 May 2002 20:01:11 +0200

	This release is the first release of the new reimplementation of
	syslog-ng. I moved to using glib instead of libol, as glib is more
	mature and provides several nice & easy to use features.
	
	Here's a bunch of nice things about 1.9.0:
	* supports flow controlled log paths (still not possible to
	  configure it, but the code exists in the core)
	* better support for macros (macro support is moved out of affile,
	  thus any other drivers may use it)
	* more robust detection of closed destination sockets (a closed
	  channel is immediately detected, not at the first write) This
	  avoids losing a log message when the connection is broken.
	* supports respawning destination programs (should be used with care
	  to avoid DoS situations). This makes it easier to integrate third party
	  extensions to syslog-ng. (SQL backends, on-line log analysis etc)
	* performance improvements, instead of using linear lookup in linked
	  lists, I use hashtables everywhere.
	* the ability to define unparsed sources, makes it easier to
	  integrate things like Apache logs
	* many internal reorganizations to make it easier to implement things like 
	  hashed log files, SSL protected TCP sessions and so on.
	  
	Things still missing:
	* there are some new features with no configuration interface
	* internal messages always go to /dev/stderr
	* Sun's STREAMS is not yet supported
	
	1.9.0 is currently in an ALPHA state, it's been tested only on my
	development computer, and not real-life traffic.
