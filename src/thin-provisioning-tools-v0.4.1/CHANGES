v0.4
====

- All tools switch to using libaio.  This gives a large performance
  boost, especially to the write focused tools like thin_restore.

- Added a progress monitor to thin_restore, cache_restore and era_restore

- Added a --quiet/-q option to *_restore to turn off the progress bar

- Removed variable hint size support from cache tools.  The kernel
  still only supports a fixed 32bit width.  This will have a side
  effect of reducing the executable sizes due to less template
  instatiation.

- Tools rolled into a single executable to save space.

- Fixed some bugs when walking bitsets (possibly effecting cache_dump
  and cache_check).
