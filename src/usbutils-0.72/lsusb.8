.IX lsusb
.SH NAME
lsusb \- list USB devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsusb
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsusb
is a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and
the devices connected to them.

To make use of all the features of this program,
you need to have a Linux kernel
which supports the /proc/bus/usb interface
(e.g., Linux kernel 2.3.15 or newer).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Tells
.I lsusb
to be verbose and display detailed information about the devices shown.
This includes configuration descriptors for the device's current speed.
Class descriptors will be shown, when available, for USB device classes
including hub, audio, HID, communications, and chipcard.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP [[\fIbus\fP]\fB:\fP][\fIdevnum\fP]
Show only devices in specified
.I bus
and/or
.I devnum.
Both ID's are given in decimal and may be omitted.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP [\fIvendor\fP]\fB:\fP[\fIproduct\fP]
Show only devices with the specified vendor and product ID.
Both ID's are given in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B \-D \fIdevice\fP
Do not scan the /proc/bus/usb directory,
instead display only information
about the device whose device file is given.
The device file should be something like /proc/bus/usb/001/001.
This option displays detailed information like the \fBv\fP option;
you must be root to do this.
.TP
.B \-t
Tells
.I lsusb
to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print  version information on standard output,
then exit successfully.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
cannot open /proc/bus/usb/\fInnn\fP/\fInnn\fP, Permission denied (13)
To get detailed information,
.I lsusb
must open the files in /proc/bus/usb in read-write mode.
You must be root in order to do this.

.SH RETURN VALUE
If the specified device is not found, a non-zero exit code is returned.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /usr/share/usb.ids
A list of all known USB ID's (vendors, products, classes, subclasses and protocols).
.TP
.B /proc/bus/usb
An interface to USB devices provided by the post-2.3.15 Linux
kernels. Contains per-bus subdirectories with per-device files and a
.I devices
file displaying some of the descriptors for each USB device.
This interface is also support by some 2.2 Linux kernels.
